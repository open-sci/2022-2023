Previous studies have shown that attended visual information is processed and represented more efficiently, but distracting visual information is not fully suppressed, and may also continue to be represented in the brain. In natural vision, to-be-attended and to-be-ignored objects may be present simultaneously in the scene. Understanding precisely how each is represented in the visual system, and how these neural representations evolve over time, remains a key goal in cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we recorded EEG while participants performed a cued object-based attention task that involved attending to target objects and ignoring simultaneously presented and spatially overlapping distractor objects. We performed support vector machine classification on the stimulus-evoked EEG data to separately track the temporal dynamics of target and distractor representations. We found that (1) both target and distractor objects were decodable during the early phase of object processing (∼100 msec to ∼200 msec after target onset), and (2) the representations of both objects were sustained over time, remaining decodable above chance until ∼1000-msec latency. However, (3) the distractor object information faded significantly beginning after about 300-msec latency. These findings provide information about the fate of attended and ignored visual information in complex scene perception.",,"Sean Noah, National Eye Institute (https://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053), grant number: T32EY015387.

500,pub.1154380038,10.1162/jocn_a_01959,36626349,,Cochlear Theta Activity Oscillates in Phase Opposition during Interaural Attention,"It is widely established that sensory perception is a rhythmic process as opposed to a continuous one. In the context of auditory perception, this effect is only established on a cortical and behavioral level. Yet, the unique architecture of the auditory sensory system allows its primary sensory cortex to modulate the processes of its sensory receptors at the cochlear level. Previously, we could demonstrate the existence of a genuine cochlear theta (∼6-Hz) rhythm that is modulated in amplitude by intermodal selective attention. As the study's paradigm was not suited to assess attentional effects on the oscillatory phase of cochlear activity, the question of whether attention can also affect the temporal organization of the cochlea's ongoing activity remained open. The present study utilizes an interaural attention paradigm to investigate ongoing otoacoustic activity during a stimulus-free cue-target interval and an omission period of the auditory target in humans. We were able to replicate the existence of the cochlear theta rhythm. Importantly, we found significant phase opposition between the two ears and attention conditions of anticipatory as well as cochlear oscillatory activity during target presentation. Yet, the amplitude was unaffected by interaural attention. These results are the first to demonstrate that intermodal and interaural attention deploy different aspects of excitation and inhibition at the first level of auditory processing. Whereas intermodal attention modulates the level of cochlear activity, interaural attention modulates the timing.",,"DOC Fellowship Programme of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (https://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001822), grant number: 25677.",Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,,"Humans; Auditory Perception; Cochlea; Inhibition, Psychological; Theta Rhythm",2023-04-01,2023,2023-04-01,2023-04-01,35,4,588-602,All OA; Green,Article,"Köhler, Moritz Herbert Albrecht; Weisz, Nathan","Köhler, Moritz Herbert Albrecht (University of Salzburg.); Weisz, Nathan (University of Salzburg.; Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.)",,"Köhler, Moritz Herbert Albrecht (University of Salzburg); Weisz, Nathan (University of Salzburg; Paracelsus Medical University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.21.481289,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154380038,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Indeed, evidence for such ""assumed similarity"" effects has been found repeatedly, at least for certain characteristics. However, recent research suggests that these findings may be an artifact of individual differences in how positively or negatively perceivers see others in general, irrespective of trait-specific content. Overcoming the limitations of prior studies, the present work provides a critical test of trait-specificity versus global positivity as sources of assumed similarity in personality judgments. In two large studies (Ns = 2,287 and 3,563) with preregistered hypotheses and analyses, perceivers rated 10 targets (strangers) each on the honesty-humility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience; HEXACO (Study 1) and Big Five (Study 2) dimensions to capture their perceptions of the ""average other"" (i.e., perceiver effects). We then computed ""positivity-corrected"" assumed similarity effects using trait-based and profile-based approaches. Although controlling for global positivity considerably reduced the strength of assumed similarity, perceiver effects were still positively related to self-reports. As predicted, these assumed similarity effects occurred foremostly for traits strongly linked to values. Specifically, in Study 1, positivity-corrected assumed similarity was observed only for honesty-humility and openness to experience, albeit meaningful effects merely occurred on one of the two self-report measures. In Study 2, traits' value-relatedness remained a unique moderator of assumed similarity after accounting for traits' positivity (i.e., social desirability). These findings demonstrate that assumed similarity is indeed, to some extent, trait-specific.

This study aimed to determine whether pair housing after heroin self-administration reduces the incubation of craving, extinction, and reinstatement of heroin seeking. Single-housed female and male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent daily 6-hr heroin self-administration, wherein active lever presses produced a heroin infusion paired with light/tone cues. One day after self-administration, rats underwent a baseline cued-seeking test wherein active lever presses only produced light/tone cues. Immediately following this cued-seeking test, rats were either pair-housed with weight- and sex-matched naïve rat or remained single-housed for the rest of the study. For 14 days, rats remained in their homecages, after which they underwent a cued-seeking test to assess the incubation of craving compared to their baseline test. Rats then underwent extinction sessions followed by cue-induced and heroin-primed reinstatements. The findings reveal that pair-housed rats did not differ from single-housed rats in terms of the incubation of craving, extinction, or reinstatement of heroin seeking. Additionally, the results did not reveal any evidence of sex-based differences in the study. The present work indicates that pair housing during the forced abstinence period does not alter measures of heroin craving/seeking. These findings suggest that the chronic stress of single housing specifically during forced abstinence does not contribute to the degree of such measures.

The results obtained from the chemical analyzes confirmed the desired stability of the human scent evidence and outlined the possible application for forensic purposes. The qualitative results of the study converge with the findings of previous studies on the composition of human scent and the chemical composition of human fingerprints. Furthermore, statistical analyzes were performed employing similarity algorithms such as Pearson's and Spearman's correlations, or Kendall's tau.

To precisely characterize the dynamic change in redox metabolism in vivo, we developed a bright genetically encoded biosensor for H2O2 (named HyPerion) and tracked the redox state of leukemic cells in situ in a transgenic sensor mouse. A H2O2-low (HyPerion-low) subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells was enriched with leukemia-initiating cells, which were endowed with high colony-forming ability, potent drug resistance, endosteal rather than vascular localization, and short survival. Significantly high expression of malic enzymes, including ME1/3, accounted for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production and the subsequent low abundance of H2O2. Deletion of malic enzymes decreased the population size of leukemia-initiating cells and impaired their leukemogenic capacity and drug resistance. In summary, by establishing an in vivo redox monitoring tool at single-cell resolution, this work reveals a critical role of redox metabolism in leukemogenesis and a potential therapeutic target.","This work was supported by grants from National Basic Research Program of China (2019YFA0801800, 2019YFA0904800, and 2018YFA0107000), National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (81825001, 32150030, 32030030, 32030065, 31971052, 81900147, 32121005, 92049304, 82000147, 32100906, 82170175, 82200172, and 31900833), the innovative group of NSFC (81721004), Shanghai Science and Technology Commission (19XD1422100, 20ZR1430900, 20JC1410100, 20JC1412000, 20204Y0008, and 17ZR1415500), Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of Optogenetic Techniques for Cell Metabolism, Research Unit of New Techniques for Live-cell Metabolic Imaging (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, 2019RU01, 2019-I2M-5-013), Major Program of Development Fund for Shanghai Zhangjiang National Innovation Demonstration Zone (Stem Cell Strategic Biobank and Stem Cell Clinical Technology Transformation Platform, ZJ2018-ZD-004), National Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (2021T140454), Innovative research team of high-level local universities in Shanghai, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences (2019-I2M-5-051), and Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of Cellular Homeostasis and Human Diseases.",,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-28,120,13,e2210796120,All OA;

A striking example of this is the freshwater polyp Hydra, where topological defects in the muscle fiber orientation have been shown to localize to key features of the body plan. This body plan is organized by morphogen concentration gradients, raising the question how muscle fiber orientation, morphogen gradients and body shape interact. Here, we introduce a minimal model that couples nematic orientational order to the gradient of a morphogen field. We show that on a planar surface, alignment to a radial concentration gradient can induce unbinding of topological defects, as observed during budding and tentacle formation in Hydra, and stabilize aster/vortex-like defects, as observed at a Hydra's mouth. On curved surfaces mimicking the morphologies of Hydra in various stages of development-from spheroid to adult-our model reproduces the experimentally observed reorganization of orientational order. Our results suggest how gradient alignment and curvature effects may work together to control orientational order during development and lay the foundations for future modeling efforts that will include the tissue mechanics that drive shape deformations.",We thank Eyal Karzbrun and Arthur Hernandez for inspiring discussions and Nikolas Claussen for critical feedback on the manuscript.

Often, we create new bonds with people that we like or feel that our relationships are damaged through the intervention of third parties. Despite their importance and the huge impact that these processes have in our lives, quantitative scientific understanding of them is still in its infancy, mainly due to the difficulty of collecting large datasets of social networks including individual attributes. In this work, we present a thorough study of real social networks of 13 schools, with more than 3,000 students and 60,000 declared positive and negative relationships, including tests for personal traits of all the students. We introduce a metric-the ""triadic influence""-that measures the influence of nearest neighbors in the relationships of their contacts. We use neural networks to predict the sign of the relationships in these social networks, extracting the probability that two students are friends or enemies depending on their personal attributes or the triadic influence. We alternatively use a high-dimensional embedding of the network structure to also predict the relationships. Remarkably, using the triadic influence (a simple one-dimensional metric) achieves the best accuracy, and adding the personal traits of the students does not improve the results, suggesting that the triadic influence acts as a proxy for the social compatibility of students.

As a result, classic paradigms are yet to be tested. One such paradigm is that variations in coastal upwelling drive changes in marine ecosystems throughout the water column. We examine this hypothesis by using data from three multidecadal time series spanning surface (0 m), midwater (200 to 1,000 m), and benthic (~4,000 m) habitats in the central California Current Upwelling System. Data include microscopic counts of surface plankton, video quantification of midwater animals, and imaging of benthic seafloor invertebrates. Taxon-specific plankton biomass and midwater and benthic animal densities were separately analyzed with principal component analysis. Within each community, the first mode of variability corresponds to most taxa increasing and decreasing over time, capturing seasonal surface blooms and lower-frequency midwater and benthic variability. When compared to local wind-driven upwelling variability, each community correlates to changes in upwelling damped over distinct timescales. This suggests that periods of high upwelling favor increase in organism biomass or density from the surface ocean through the midwater down to the abyssal seafloor. These connections most likely occur directly via changes in primary production and vertical carbon flux, and to a lesser extent indirectly via other oceanic changes. The timescales over which species respond to upwelling are taxon-specific and are likely linked to the longevity of phytoplankton blooms (surface) and of animal life (midwater and benthos), which dictate how long upwelling-driven changes persist within each community.","We rely on and are grateful for the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) ships, crews, and pilots we have worked with over the years.

However, the relationships between these symptoms are poorly understood. As a step toward improving treatment, this study investigated associations between specific aspects of motor control and cognitive control in children with varying levels of hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. A heterogeneous sample of 255 children of 4 to 10 years of age (median = 6.50, MAD = 1.36) completed a battery of tests probing motor generation, visuomotor fluency, visuomotor flexibility, cognitive inhibition, verbal and visuospatial working memory, and cognitive flexibility. Their caregivers were interviewed regarding their hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. 25.9% of the main sample met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine whether specific aspects of motor control were associated with specific aspects of cognitive control, and whether any associations were moderated by hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Additionally, cognitive modeling (the drift diffusion model approximated with EZ-DM) was used to understand performance on a cognitive inhibition task. Visuomotor fluency was significantly associated with cognitive inhibition. Visuomotor flexibility was significantly associated with cognitive flexibility. There were no significant moderation effects. Cognitive modeling was inconclusive. In conclusion, the ability to fluently perform visually guided continuous movement is linked with the ability to inhibit the effects of distracting information. The ability to spontaneously use visual information to flexibly alter motor responses is related to the ability to cognitively shift from one frame of mind to another. These relationships appear to be quantitatively and qualitatively similar across the childhood hyperactive-impulsive continuum as rated by parents.",,,Child Neuropsychology,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,,,1-26,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Ferguson, Cameron; Hobson, Christopher; Hedge, Craig; Waters, Cerith; Anning, Kate; van Goozen, Stephanie","Ferguson, Cameron (School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.; Community Neurological Rehabilitation Service, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, NHS Wales, United Kingdom, Newport.); Hobson, Christopher (South Wales Doctoral Programme in Clinical Psychology, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, NHS Wales, United Kingdom, Cardiff.; Neurodevelopment Assessment Unit, Cardiff University, United Kingdom, Cardiff.); Hedge, Craig (School of Psychology, Aston University United Kingdom Aston.); Waters, Cerith (South Wales Doctoral Programme in Clinical Psychology, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, NHS Wales, United Kingdom, Cardiff.; Neurodevelopment Assessment Unit, Cardiff University, United Kingdom, Cardiff.); Anning, Kate (Neurodevelopment Assessment Unit, Cardiff University, United Kingdom, Cardiff.); van Goozen, Stephanie (Neurodevelopment Assessment Unit, Cardiff University, United Kingdom, Cardiff.)",,"Ferguson, Cameron (University of Bristol; Aneurin Bevan University Health Board); Hobson, Christopher (Cardiff and Vale University Health Board; Cardiff University); Hedge, Craig (); Waters, Cerith (Cardiff and Vale University Health Board; Cardiff University); Anning, Kate (Cardiff University); van Goozen, Stephanie (Cardiff University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/09297049.2023.2190965,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156413859,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

Consequently, the alignment of these computational models with behavioural studies of reading development has to date been limited. Models of reading have provided us with insights into the architecture of the reading system, and these have recently been extended to investigate literacy development, and the early language skills that influence children's reading. These models show us: how learning to read builds on early language skills, why various reading interventions might be more or less effective for different children, and how reading develops across different languages and writing systems. Though there is growing alignment between descriptive models of reading behaviour and computational models, there remains a gap, and I lay out the groundwork for how translation may become increasingly effective through future modelling work.",,,Journal of Child Language,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,,,1-17,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Monaghan, Padraic","Monaghan, Padraic (Lancaster University, UK.)",,"Monaghan, Padraic (Lancaster University)",0,0,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/F482E3C2A79586D03DA4D3B3CCE84D1B/S0305000923000193a.pdf/div-class-title-literacy-and-early-language-development-insights-from-computational-modelling-div.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156413871,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4704 Linguistics; 52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology",4 Quality Education

The present study is a randomized controlled trial carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to explore whether a yoga intervention could have a positive impact on balance and flexibility and be the primary form of home exercise for female college students in China. Forty female college students were randomly selected for the study. After 16 weeks of yoga intervention, the ability of the yoga group to balance on one leg improved by 5.35 seconds (using the single-limb stance test) and 5.7 seconds (using the Romberg test). The flexibility of the lower back and legs increased by 3.5 cm (using the sit and reach test), and the flexibility of the groin and hip increased by 6 cm (using the Splits test). The balance ability and flexibility of the control group before and after the experiment were not significantly different (p>0.05). These results suggest that during the COVID-19 outbreak when access to public facilities was limited, a yoga intervention could have a positive impact on health and be the main form of home exercise for female college students.

Our main objective was to study the relationship between breastfeeding duration and cerebral gray matter volumes. We also explored the potential mediatory role of brain volumes on behavior.
METHODS: We analyzed 7,860 magnetic resonance images of children 9-11 years of age from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset in order to study the relationship between breastfeeding duration and cerebral gray matter volumes. We also obtained several behavioral data (cognition, behavioral problems, prodromal psychotic experiences, prosociality, impulsivity) to explore the potential mediatory role of brain volumes on behavior.
RESULTS: In the 7,860 children analyzed (median age = 9 years and 11 months; 49.9% female), whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed an association mainly between breastfeeding duration and larger bilateral volumes of the pars orbitalis and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. In particular, the association with the left pars orbitalis and the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex proved to be very robust to the addition of potentially confounding covariates, random selection of siblings, and splitting the sample in two. The volume of the left pars orbitalis and the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex appeared to mediate the relationship between breastfeeding duration and the negative urgency dimension of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale. Global gray matter volumes were also significant mediators for behavioral problems as measured with the Child Behavior Checklist.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that breastfeeding is a relevant factor in the proper development of the brain, particularly for the pars orbitalis and lateral orbitofrontal cortex regions. This, in turn, may impact impulsive personality and mental health in early puberty.","Acknowledgements Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study (https://abcdstudy.org), held in the NIMH Data Archive (NDA).

The change of pubescence form from appressed to erect is a notable feature during soybean domestication. However, the biological significance and regulatory mechanism underlying this transformation remain largely unknown. Here, we identified a major-effect locus, PUBESCENCE FORM 1 (PF1), the upstream region of Mao1, that regulates pubescence form in soybean. The insertion of a Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon in PF1 can recruit the transcription factor GAGA-binding protein to a GA-rich region, which up-regulates Mao1 expression, underpinning soybean pubescence evolution. Interestingly, the proportion of improved cultivars with erect pubescence increases gradually with increasing latitude, and erect-pubescence cultivars have a higher yield possibly through a higher photosynthetic rate and photosynthetic stability. These findings open an avenue for molecular breeding through either natural introgression or genome editing toward yield improvement and productivity.","We would like to thank Mingcai Zhang, Zuofeng Zhu, Lubin Tan, and Zeyang Ma from the China Agricultural University for their valuable feedback.

There is an extensive body of neuroscience research showing that contemplative practices, such as mindfulness, produce measurable effects on brain function and overall well-being. We hypothesized that a mindfulness-based training program designed for engineering graduate students would improve emotional well-being and, secondarily, enhance research capacity. An initial pilot study was conducted at a single institution (Phase 1), followed by a larger study conducted at both the original and a second institution (Phase 2) to gather additional data and show the program's transferability. The program comprised eight weekly mindfulness training sessions. Individuals in the study were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or wait-list control group. We administered pre- and post-test surveys with quantitative measures designed to assess emotional and physical well-being, as well as creativity, research satisfaction, and desire to contribute to the betterment of society. Participants also completed a summative survey to evaluate the impact of the program on their well-being and research. Analysis revealed statistically significant findings: improved emotional health, decreased neuroticism, increased positive affect, decreased negative affect, and increased mindfulness in the intervention groups compared to the control groups. Intervention groups in Phase 2 also reported statistically significant improvement in satisfaction with their research. Our findings suggest that mindfulness training has the potential to play a vital professional and personal development role in graduate engineering education.","We would like to recognize and thank the following colleagues at the University of Virginia (UVA) for partnering with us to implement the UVA component of Phase 2: Professor David Germano, Executive Director of the Contemplative Sciences Center; Professor Pamela Norris, Executive Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science; and Leslie Hubbard, Program Director in the Contemplative Sciences Center.

Genome-wide association studies in chronic pain patients have identified hundreds of common pathogenic variants, yet they only explained a portion of individual variance of chronic pain. With the advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, it is now feasible to conduct rarer variants studies in large-scale databases. Here, we performed gene-based rare variant analyses in 200,000 human subjects in the UK biobank whole-exome sequencing database for investigating 9 different chronic pain states and validated our findings in 3 other large-scale databases. Our analyses identified the SLC13A1 gene coding for sodium/sulfate symporter associated with chronic back pain and multisite pain at the genome-wide level and with chronic headache, knee, and neck and shoulder pain at the nominal level. Seven loss-of-function rare variants were identified within the gene locus potentially contributing to the development of chronic pain, with 2 of them individually associated with back pain and multisite pain. These 2 rare variants were then tested for replication in 3 other biobanks, and the strongest evidence was found for rs28364172 as an individual contributor. Transcriptional analyses of Slc13a1 in rodents showed substantial regulation of its expression in the dorsal root ganglia and the sciatic nerve in neuropathic pain assays. Our results stress the importance of the SLC13A1 gene in sulfate homeostasis in the nervous system and its critical role in preventing pain states, thus suggesting new therapeutic approaches for treating chronic pain in a personalized manner, especially in people with mutations in the SLC13A1 gene.",,,Pain,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,Publish Ahead of Print,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Ao, Xiang; Parisien, Marc; Zidan, Maha; Grant, Audrey V; Martinsen, Amy E; Winsvold, Bendik S; Diatchenko, Luda","Ao, Xiang (Faculty of Dental Medicine and Oral Health Sciences, Department of Anesthesia, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Alan Edwards Centre for Research on Pain, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.); Parisien, Marc (Faculty of Dental Medicine and Oral Health Sciences, Department of Anesthesia, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Alan Edwards Centre for Research on Pain, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.); Zidan, Maha (Faculty of Dental Medicine and Oral Health Sciences, Department of Anesthesia, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Alan Edwards Centre for Research on Pain, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.); Grant, Audrey V (Faculty of Dental Medicine and Oral Health Sciences, Department of Anesthesia, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Alan Edwards Centre for Research on Pain, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.); Martinsen, Amy E (Department of Research, Innovation and Education, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.; K.

Here, we showed that the knockdown of the PARP1 extended the lifespan of Drosophila, with particular emphasis on the skeletal muscle. The muscle-specific mutant Drosophila exhibited resistance to starvation and oxidative stress, as well as an increased ability to climb, with enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and activity at an older age. Mechanistically, the inhibition of PARP1 increases the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKα) and mitochondrial turnover. PARP1 could interact with AMPKα and then regulate it via poly(ADP ribosyl)ation (PARylation) at residues E155 and E195. Double knockdown of PARP1 and AMPKα, specifically in muscle, could counteract the effects of PARP1 inhibition in Drosophila. Finally, we showed that increasing lifespan via maintaining mitochondrial network homeostasis required intact PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1). Taken together, these data indicate that the interplay between PARP1 and AMPKα can manipulate mitochondrial turnover, and be targeted to promote longevity.","We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Xinhua Lin and Dr. Yun Qi of the State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics at Fudan University.

This study tested whether four FTD dimensions differ in their association with brain perfusion and brain structure.
STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study investigated 110 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders using 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The Thought and Language Disorder scale (TALD) was utilized, which comprises four subscales: Objective Positive (OP), Objective Negative (ON), Subjective Positive (SP), and Subjective Negative (SN). Resting-state cerebral blood flow (rsCBF), cortical thickness (CortTh), gray matter volume (GMV), and diffusion MRI tractography were tested for associations with TALD subscales controlling for age, medication, total intracranial volume, and for variance of the 3 other TALD subscales.
STUDY RESULTS: Following Bonferroni correction, the FTD dimensions presented distinct neural correlates. OP scores were associated with increased rsCBF and increased GMV in the right cerebellum lingual gyrus. Higher SP scores were linked to increased GMV in bilateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, ON was associated with increased GMV in the right premotor cortex. At more liberal statistical thresholds, higher SP was associated with increased CortTh in the right inferior frontal gyrus, whereas SN scores were linked to decreased GMV in the right prefrontal lobe, the left inferior temporal gyrus, and the left supplementary motor area. Unadjusted analyses mostly corroborated these findings.
CONCLUSION: These findings stress the heterogeneity in FTD, suggesting distinct neural patterns for specific FTD experiences. In sum, FTD in psychosis may require distinct treatment strategies and further mechanistic investigations on single-item levels.",,,Schizophrenia Bulletin,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,49,Supplement_2,s104-s114,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Maderthaner, Lydia; Pavlidou, Anastasia; Lefebvre, Stephanie; Nadesalingam, Niluja; Chapellier, Victoria; von Känel, Sofie; Kyrou, Alexandra; Alexaki, Danai; Wüthrich, Florian; Weiss, Florian; Baumann-Gama, Daniel; Wiest, Roland; Strik, Werner; Kircher, Tilo; Walther, Sebastian","Maderthaner, Lydia (Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.); Pavlidou, Anastasia (Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Translational Imaging Center (TIC), Swiss Institute for Translational and Entrepreneurial Medicine, Bern, Switzerland.); Lefebvre, Stephanie (Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Translational Imaging Center (TIC), Swiss Institute for Translational and Entrepreneurial Medicine, Bern, Switzerland.); Nadesalingam, Niluja (Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Translational Imaging Center (TIC), Swiss Institute for Translational and Entrepreneurial Medicine, Bern, Switzerland.); Chapellier, Victoria (Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Translational Imaging Center (TIC), Swiss Institute for Translational and Entrepreneurial Medicine, Bern, Switzerland.); von Känel, Sofie (Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Translational Imaging Center (TIC), Swiss Institute for Translational and Entrepreneurial Medicine, Bern, Switzerland.); Kyrou, Alexandra (Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.); Alexaki, Danai (Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.); Wüthrich, Florian (Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.); Weiss, Florian (Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.); Baumann-Gama, Daniel (Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.); Wiest, Roland (Translational Imaging Center (TIC), Swiss Institute for Translational and Entrepreneurial Medicine, Bern, Switzerland.; Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Inselspital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.); Strik, Werner (Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.); Kircher, Tilo (Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany.); Walther, Sebastian (Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Translational Imaging Center (TIC), Swiss Institute for Translational and Entrepreneurial Medicine, Bern, Switzerland.)",,"Maderthaner, Lydia (University of Bern); Pavlidou, Anastasia (University of Bern); Lefebvre, Stephanie (University of Bern); Nadesalingam, Niluja (University of Bern); Chapellier, Victoria (University of Bern); von Känel, Sofie (University of Bern); Kyrou, Alexandra (University of Bern); Alexaki, Danai (University of Bern); Wüthrich, Florian (University of Bern); Weiss, Florian (University of Bern); Baumann-Gama, Daniel (University of Bern); Wiest, Roland (University of Bern; University Hospital of Bern); Strik, Werner (University of Bern); Kircher, Tilo (Philipps University of Marburg); Walther, Sebastian (University of Bern)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbac120,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401022,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

A recent meta-analysis identified an acoustic profile associated with schizophrenia (reduced pitch variability and increased pauses), but also highlighted shortcomings in the field: small sample sizes, little attention to the heterogeneity of the disorder, and to generalizing findings to diverse samples and languages.
STUDY DESIGN: We provide a critical cumulative approach to vocal atypicalities in schizophrenia, where we conceptually and statistically build on previous studies. We aim at identifying a cross-linguistically reliable acoustic profile of schizophrenia and assessing sources of heterogeneity (symptomatology, pharmacotherapy, clinical and social characteristics). We relied on previous meta-analysis to build and analyze a large cross-linguistic dataset of audio recordings of 231 patients with schizophrenia and 238 matched controls (>4000 recordings in Danish, German, Mandarin and Japanese). We used multilevel Bayesian modeling, contrasting meta-analytically informed and skeptical inferences.
STUDY RESULTS: We found only a minimal generalizable acoustic profile of schizophrenia (reduced pitch variability), while duration atypicalities replicated only in some languages. We identified reliable associations between acoustic profile and individual differences in clinical ratings of negative symptoms, medication, age and gender. However, these associations vary across languages.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that a strong cross-linguistically reliable acoustic profile of schizophrenia is unlikely. Rather, if we are to devise effective clinical applications able to target different ranges of patients, we need first to establish larger and more diverse cross-linguistic datasets, focus on individual differences, and build self-critical cumulative approaches.",,,Schizophrenia Bulletin,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,49,Supplement_2,s125-s141,All OA; Green,Article,"Parola, Alberto; Simonsen, Arndis; Lin, Jessica Mary; Zhou, Yuan; Wang, Huiling; Ubukata, Shiho; Koelkebeck, Katja; Bliksted, Vibeke; Fusaroli, Riccardo","Parola, Alberto (Department of Linguistics, Cognitive Science and Semiotics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; The Interacting Minds Center, Institute of Culture and Society, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Psychology, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.); Simonsen, Arndis (The Interacting Minds Center, Institute of Culture and Society, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Psychosis Research Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.); Lin, Jessica Mary (Department of Linguistics, Cognitive Science and Semiotics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; The Interacting Minds Center, Institute of Culture and Society, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.); Zhou, Yuan (Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.); Wang, Huiling (Department of Psychiatry, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.); Ubukata, Shiho (Department of Psychiatry, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.); Koelkebeck, Katja (LVR-Hospital Essen, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Hospital and Institute of the University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.; Center for Translational Neuro- and Behavioral Sciences (C-TNBS), University Duisburg-Essen, Germany.); Bliksted, Vibeke (The Interacting Minds Center, Institute of Culture and Society, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Psychosis Research Unit, Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.); Fusaroli, Riccardo (Department of Linguistics, Cognitive Science and Semiotics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; The Interacting Minds Center, Institute of Culture and Society, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Linguistic Data Consortium, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA.)",,"Parola, Alberto (Aarhus University; Aarhus University; University of Turin); Simonsen, Arndis (Aarhus University; Aarhus University); Lin, Jessica Mary (Aarhus University; Aarhus University); Zhou, Yuan (Institute of Psychology); Wang, Huiling (Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University); Ubukata, Shiho (Kyoto University); Koelkebeck, Katja (University of Duisburg-Essen; University of Duisburg-Essen); Bliksted, Vibeke (Aarhus University; Aarhus University); Fusaroli, Riccardo (Aarhus University; Aarhus University; University of Pennsylvania)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.03.22273354,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156413983,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,

Unfortunately, the same robust parenting interventions which have long targeted some of the most common and the most treatable child concerns (e.g., externalizing, disruptive behavior, and aggression) have also shown consistently low rates of father engagement. This persistent issue of engagement comes in the wake of an increasingly large body of literature which highlights the unique positive contributions fathers make to children and families when they are engaged in parenting interventions. As the role fathers play in families shifts to become more inclusive of childcare responsibilities and less narrowly defined by financial contributions, it becomes increasingly important to understand how best to engage fathers in interventions that aim to enhance parenting efficacy and family outcomes such as coparenting. The current review examined intervention (e.g., format and setting) and implementation characteristics (e.g., training and agency-level changes) associated with father engagement. Particular attention is paid to studies which described father-specific engagement strategies (e.g., inviting fathers directly, father-only groups, and adapting intervention to incorporate father preferences). A total of 26 articles met inclusion criteria after screening and full-text review. Results indicate that father engagement (i.e., initiating treatment) remains low with 58% of studies either not reporting father engagement or having engagement rates below 50%. More than two-thirds of studies did not include specific father engagement strategies. Those that did focused on changes to treatment format (e.g., including recreational activities), physical treatment setting (e.g., in-home and school), and reducing the number of sessions required for father participation as the most common father-specific engagement strategies. Some studies reported efforts to target racially and ethnically diverse fathers, but review results indicated most participants identified as Non-Hispanic White. Interventions were largely standard behavioral parent training programs (e.g., PCIT and PMT) with few exceptions (e.g., COACHES and cultural adaptations), and very few agencies or programs are systematically making adjustments (e.g., extended clinic hours and changes to treatment format) to engage fathers. Recommendations for future directions of research are discussed including the impact of differential motivation on initial father engagement in treatment, the importance of continuing to support diverse groups of fathers, and the potential for telehealth to address barriers to father engagement.","Acknowledgements

Understanding the factors that lead social media users to amplify (or indeed intervene in) the spread of this content is an ongoing challenge. Prior research suggests that users are not only more likely to interact with misinformation that supports their ideology or their political beliefs, they may also feel it is more acceptable to spread. However, less is known about the influence of newer, issue-specific beliefs. Two online studies explored the relationship between the degree of belief-consistency of disinformation on users' moral judgements and intentions to spread disinformation further. Four disinformation narratives were presented: disinformation that supported or undermined the UK Government's handling of COVID-19, and disinformation that minimised or maximised the perceived risk of COVID-19. A novel scale for measuring intentions to contribute to the spread of social media content was also used in study 2. Participants reported greater likelihood of spreading false material that was consistent with their beliefs. More lenient moral judgements related to the degree of belief-consistency with disinformation, even when participants were aware the material was false or misleading. These moral judgements partially mediated the relationship between belief-consistency of content and intentions to spread it further on social media. While people are concerned about the spread of disinformation generally, they may evaluate belief-consistent disinformation differently from others in a way that permits them to spread it further. As social media platforms prioritise the ordering of feeds based on personal relevance, there is a risk that users could be being presented with disinformation that they are more tolerant of.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0281777,All OA; Gold,Article,"Joyner, Laura; Buchanan, Tom; Yetkili, Orkun","Joyner, Laura (School of Social Sciences, University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom.); Buchanan, Tom (School of Social Sciences, University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom.); Yetkili, Orkun (School of Social Sciences, University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom.)",,"Joyner, Laura (University of Westminster); Buchanan, Tom (University of Westminster); Yetkili, Orkun (University of Westminster)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281777&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401256,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

METHODS: In total, 7164 individual twins (84.12% complete pairs; 59.81% female; mean age = 30.58 years) from the Australian Twin Registry reported their lifetime misuse of prescription opioids, stimulants, and sedatives, and lifetime use of heroin, cannabis, cocaine/crack, illicit stimulants, hallucinogens, inhalants, solvents, and dissociatives via telephone interview. Independent pathway models (IPMs) and common pathway models (CPMs) partitioned the variance of drug use phenotypes into general and drug-specific genetic (a), common environmental (c), and unique environmental factors (e).
RESULTS: An IPM with one general a and one general e factor and a one-factor CPM provided comparable fit to the data. General factors accounted for 55% (a = 14%, e = 41%) and 79% (a = 64%, e = 15%) of the respective variation in POM and heroin use in the IPM, and 25% (a = 12%, c = 8%, e = 5%) and 80% (a = 38%, c = 27%, e = 15%) of the respective variation in POM and heroin use in the CPM. Across both models, POM emerged with substantial drug-specific genetic influence (26-39% of total phenotypic variance; 69-74% of genetic variance); heroin use did not (0% of total phenotypic variance; 0% of genetic variance in both models). Prescription sedative misuse also demonstrated significant drug-specific genetic variance.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation in POM, but not heroin use, is predominantly drug-specific. Misuse of prescription medications that reduce experiences of subjective distress may be partially influenced by sources of genetic variation separate from illicit drug use.",,,Psychological Medicine,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,,,1-10,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Dash, Genevieve F; Gizer, Ian R; Martin, Nicholas G; Slutske, Wendy S","Dash, Genevieve F (Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211, USA.); Gizer, Ian R (Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211, USA.); Martin, Nicholas G (QIMR Berghofer, Brisbane, Queensland 4006, Australia.); Slutske, Wendy S (Department of Family Medicine and Community Health and Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53711, USA.)",,"Dash, Genevieve F (University of Missouri); Gizer, Ian R (University of Missouri); Martin, Nicholas G (QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute); Slutske, Wendy S (University of Wisconsin–Madison)",0,0,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/746CB8F79076A9C819F95CFA02E05921/S003329172300034Xa.pdf/div-class-title-specificity-in-genetic-and-environmental-risk-for-prescription-opioid-misuse-and-heroin-use-div.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156413880,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,

To investigate the progression, 3D cell cultures are widely used along with different types of matrices. Currently, the matrices are often characterized using parallel-plate rheometry for matrix viscoelasticity, or liquid-like viscous and stiffness-related elastic characteristics. The characterization reveals averaged information and sample-to-sample variation, yet, it neglects internal heterogeneity within matrices, experienced by cancer cells in 3D culture. Techniques using optical tweezers and magnetic microrheometry have measured heterogeneity in viscoelasticity in 3D culture. However, there is a lack of probabilistic heterogeneity quantification and cell-size-relevant, microscale-viscoelasticity measurements at breast-tumor tissue stiffness up to ≃10 kPa in Young's modulus. Here, we have advanced methods, for the purpose, which use a magnetic microrheometer that applies forces on magnetic spheres within matrices, and detects the spheres displacements. We present probabilistic heterogeneity quantification using microscale-viscoelasticity measurements in 3D culture matrices at breast-tumor-relevant stiffness levels. Bayesian multilevel modeling was employed to distinguish heterogeneity in viscoelasticity from the effects of experimental design and measurement errors. We report about the heterogeneity of breast-tumor-relevant agarose, GrowDex, GrowDex-collagen and fibrin matrices. The degree of heterogeneity differs for stiffness, and phase angle (i.e. ratio between viscous and elastic characteristics). Concerning stiffness, agarose and GrowDex show the lowest and highest heterogeneity, respectively. Concerning phase angle, fibrin and GrowDex-collagen present the lowest and the highest heterogeneity, respectively. While this heterogeneity information involves softer matrices, probed by ≃30 μm magnetic spheres, we employ larger ≃100 μm spheres to increase magnetic forces and acquire a sufficient displacement signal-to-noise ratio in stiffer matrices. Thus, we show pointwise microscale viscoelasticity measurements within agarose matrices up to Young's moduli of 10 kPa. These results establish methods that combine magnetic microrheometry and Bayesian multilevel modeling for enhanced heterogeneity analysis within 3D culture matrices.",We acknowledge Mari Kielosto and Väinö Mäntylä for their help in the related matrix investigation.,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0282511,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lehtonen, Arttu J; Arasalo, Ossi; Srbova, Linda; Heilala, Maria; Pokki, Juho","Lehtonen, Arttu J (Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland.); Arasalo, Ossi (Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland.); Srbova, Linda (Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland.); Heilala, Maria (Department of Applied Physics, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland.); Pokki, Juho (Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland.)",,"Lehtonen, Arttu J (Aalto University); Arasalo, Ossi (Aalto University); Srbova, Linda (Aalto University); Heilala, Maria (Aalto University); Pokki, Juho (Aalto University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282511&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401265,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering,

To this end, we estimate models that predict students' results in two national standardized tests: a test that does not affect students' educational trajectory, and a second test that determines access to the most selective universities in Chile. We used data from different gender twins who took these tests. This strategy allows us to control, through household fixed effects, the observed and unobserved household characteristics. Our results show that competitive tests negatively affect women. In Mathematics, according to both tests, there is a gender gap in favor of men, which increases in the university entrance exam, especially for high-performance students. As the literature review shows, women are negatively stereotyped in Mathematics, so this stereotype threat could penalize high-achieving women, that is, those that go against the stereotype. In Language tests, women outperform men in the standardized test taken in high school, but the situation is reversed in the university entrance exam. From our analysis of Chilean national data, we find no evidence that the gender effect observed in the competitive test depends on the students' achievement level. Following the literature, this gender gap may be linked to women's risk aversion, lower self-confidence, lower preference for competition, as well as the effect of answering a test under time pressure.","We thank Carlos Budnevich for his excellent research assistance.

India has the highest burden of human tuberculosis in the world and any zoonotic risk posed by tuberculosis in bovines needs to be managed at the source of infection as a part of efforts to end human tuberculosis. Zoonotic tuberculosis in humans can be severe and is clinically indistinguishable from non-zoonotic tuberculosis. As a consequence, zoonotic tuberculosis remains under-recognised and the significance of its contribution to human tuberculosis is poorly understood. This study aimed to explore any association between bovine density, bovine ownership, and human tuberculosis reporting in India using self-reported tuberculosis data in households and officially reported tuberculosis cases while controlling for common confounders for human tuberculosis. We find an association between human tuberculosis reporting, bovine density and bovine ownership in India. Buffalo density was significantly associated with an increased risk of self-reported tuberculosis in households (odds ratio (OR) = 1.23 (95% credible interval (CI): 1.10-1.39) at household level; incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.17 (95% CI: 1.04-1.33) at district level), while cattle density (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.71-0.89; IRR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.70-0.87) and ownership of bovines in households (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.9-0.99; IRR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.57-0.79) had a protective association with tuberculosis reporting. It is unclear whether this relates to differences in tuberculosis transmission dynamics, or perhaps an association between bovines and other unexplored confounders for tuberculosis reporting in humans. Our study highlights a need for structured surveillance to estimate the prevalence of tuberculosis in cattle and buffaloes, characterisation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex species present in bovines and transmission analyses at the human-animal interface to better assess the burden and risk pathways of zoonotic tuberculosis in India.","We thank Professor Megan B Murray (Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School) for advice on using tuberculosis surveillance systems in India.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0283357,All OA; Gold,Article,"Willgert, Katriina; da Silva, Susie; Li, Ruoran; Dandapat, Premanshu; Veerasami, Maroudam; Maity, Hindol; Papanna, Mohan; Srinivasan, Sreenidhi; Wood, James L N; Kapur, Vivek; Conlan, Andrew J K","Willgert, Katriina (Disease Dynamics Unit (DDU), Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.); da Silva, Susie (Disease Dynamics Unit (DDU), Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.); Li, Ruoran (Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

However, the effects on rearfoot strike runners remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of surfaces on the running kinematics, kinetics, and lower-limb stiffness of habitual rearfoot strikers. Thirty healthy male runners were recruited to run at 3.3 ± 0.2 m/s on a customized runway covered with three different surfaces (artificial grass, synthetic rubber, or concrete), and their running kinematics, kinetics, and lower-limb stiffness were compared. Differences among the three surfaces were examined using statistical parametric mapping and one-way repeated-measure analysis of variance. There were no statistical differences in the lower-limb joint motion, vertical ground reaction force (GRF), loading rates, and lower-limb stiffness when running on the three surfaces. The braking force (17%-36% of the stance phase) and mediolateral GRF were decreased when running on concrete surface compared with running on the other two surfaces. The moments of ankle joint in all three plane movement and frontal plane hip and knee joints were increased when running on concrete surface. Therefore, habitual rearfoot strikers may expose to a higher risk of running-related overuse injuries when running on a harder surface.",The authors are grateful to all the subjects’ voluntary contribution during the completion of this study.,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0283323,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhou, Wenxing; Yin, Lulu; Jiang, Jiayi; Zhang, Yu; Hsiao, Cheng-Pang; Chen, Yiyang; Mo, Shiwei; Wang, Lin","Zhou, Wenxing (Key Laboratory of Exercise and Health Sciences (Shanghai University of Sport), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China.; School of Exercise and Health, Shanghai University of Sport, Shanghai, China.); Yin, Lulu (School of Exercise and Health, Shanghai University of Sport, Shanghai, China.); Jiang, Jiayi (Department of Physiotherapy, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.); Zhang, Yu (Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, The Tenth People's Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University, Shanghai, China.); Hsiao, Cheng-Pang (School of Exercise and Health, Shanghai University of Sport, Shanghai, China.); Chen, Yiyang (Department of Kinesiology and Physical Activity, McGill University, Quebec, Canada.); Mo, Shiwei (Human Performance Laboratory, School of Physical Education, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.); Wang, Lin (School of Exercise and Health, Shanghai University of Sport, Shanghai, China.)",,"Zhou, Wenxing (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; Shanghai University of Sport); Yin, Lulu (Shanghai University of Sport); Jiang, Jiayi (Monash University); Zhang, Yu (Tongji University); Hsiao, Cheng-Pang (Shanghai University of Sport); Chen, Yiyang (McGill University); Mo, Shiwei (Shenzhen University); Wang, Lin (Shanghai University of Sport)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283323&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401222,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science; 4207 Sports Science and Exercise,

This population-based longitudinal cohort study aimed to analyze the change in the annual incidence rate of central precocious puberty (CPP) among Korean children over the most recent decade, using the national registry data.
METHOD: The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and insurance claims for gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) treatment were used to identify CPP patients who were using the Korean Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service (HIRA) database between 2008 and 2020. Patients who began GnRHa therapy before the age of 9 and 10 for girls and boys, respectively, were included in the study.
RESULTS: A total of 6,906 boys and 126,377 girls were diagnosed with CPP between 2008 and 2020. The annual incidence of CPP increased by 83.3 times in boys (from 1.2 to 100 per 100,000 persons) and by 15.9 times in girls (from 88.9 to 1414.7 per 100,000 persons). The age-specific annual incidence of CPP increased remarkably more in older children than in younger ones; the 2020 CPP incidence among 9-year-old boys and 8-year-old girls reached 705.2 and 7,967.3 per 100,000 persons, respectively. The annual prevalence of CPP in boys and girls increased from 2.7 to 206.5 (76.5 times) and from 141.8 to 3439.9 (24.3 times) per 100,000 persons, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Based on GnRHa treatment insurance claims, our study suggests that the annual incidence of CPP has substantially increased in Korea during the past 13 years. These findings highlight the importance of meticulous judgment by doctors in determining GnRHa treatment.",We gratefully acknowledge the Korean Health Insurance Review Agency for allowing us to use the data.,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0283510,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kang, Sinyoung; Park, Mi Jung; Kim, Jung Min; Yuk, Jin-Sung; Kim, Shin-Hye","Kang, Sinyoung (Department of Pediatrics, Samil Hospital, Daegu, Korea.); Park, Mi Jung (Dr. Park Mijung's Child Growth Clinic, Seoul, Korea.); Kim, Jung Min (Department of Internal Medicine, Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital, Seoul, Korea.); Yuk, Jin-Sung (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital, Seoul, Korea.); Kim, Shin-Hye (Department of Pediatrics, Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital, Seoul, Korea.)",,"Kang, Sinyoung (); Park, Mi Jung (); Kim, Jung Min (Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital); Yuk, Jin-Sung (Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital); Kim, Shin-Hye (Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283510&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401232,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3213 Paediatrics,

In the Pacific Arctic Region spanning the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas, DA is recognized as an emerging human and ecosystem health threat, yet little is known about the composition and distribution of Pseudo-nitzschia species in these waters. This investigation characterized Pseudo-nitzschia assemblages in samples collected in 2018 during summer (August) and fall (October-November) surveys as part of the Distributed Biological Observatory and Arctic Observing Network, encompassing a broad geographic range (57.8° to 73.0°N, -138.9° to -169.9°W) and spanning temperature (-1.79 to 11.7°C) and salinity (22.9 to 32.9) gradients associated with distinct water masses. Species were identified using a genus-specific Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA). Seventeen amplicons were observed; seven corresponded to temperate, sub-polar, or polar Pseudo-nitzschia species based on parallel sequencing efforts (P. arctica, P. delicatissima, P. granii, P. obtusa, P. pungens, and two genotypes of P. seriata), and one represented Fragilariopsis oceanica. During summer, particulate DA (pDA; 4.0 to 130.0 ng L-1) was observed in the Bering Strait and Chukchi Sea where P. obtusa was prevalent. In fall, pDA (3.3 to 111.8 ng L-1) occurred along the Beaufort Sea shelf coincident with one P. seriata genotype, and south of the Bering Strait in association with the other P. seriata genotype. Taxa were correlated with latitude, longitude, temperature, salinity, pDA, and/or chlorophyll a, and each had a distinct distribution pattern. The observation of DA in association with different species, seasons, geographic regions, and water masses underscores the significant risk of Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP) and DA-poisoning in Alaska waters.",We would like to acknowledge the science parties and vessel crews that facilitated and assisted with sampling on the two 2018 surveys aboard the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Healy.

The continuum of the recommended feeding practices has been an utmost challenge among caregivers during the transition from health facilities to homes for improved under-five children's health.
OBJECTIVE: This study assessed feeding practices, dietary diversities, and dietary adequacy among caregivers with under-five children in the Dodoma region, Tanzania.
METHODS: A community-based descriptive cross-sectional study in a quantitative research approach was adopted to study 289 randomly selected caregivers of under-five children in Dodoma region, Tanzania from March to August 2022. The World Health Organization Infant and Young Children Feeding Guidelines was the main data collection tool. Data were analyzed descriptively using a Statistical Package for Social Sciences computer software program version 25. Statistical limits were set at a 95% confidence interval and a 5% significance level.
RESULTS: Mean age was 26±6.47 of which 68.2% (n = 197) were females. Findings revealed 66.1% of caregivers had unsatisfactory feeding practices. It was observed that 67.8% of the caregivers fed their under-five children inadequately. Only 32.2% of them attained the minimum dietary diversity while 35.3% and 31.5% of caregivers demonstrated feeding practices < and > the recommended minimum Dietary diversity respectively. Moreover, 90.7% of caregivers fed their children group one food while 59.1% of them did not practice feeding the children snacks between meals. Feeding practice, dietary diversity, and dietary adequacy were significantly related to the caregiver's sex, education level, and socioeconomic status (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Under-five children are at serious risk of nutritional problems as most caregivers in this study demonstrated unsatisfactory feeding practices on dietary diversities for dietary adequacy below the world health organization recommended Minimum Dietary diversity and Minimum Meal Frequency. Community-based nutritional education programs for caregivers need to be disseminated to the community level to address the problem accordingly.",It is a privilege to thank our Almighty God for the life and strengths of accomplishing this work.

The assessment of GWF and its efficiency is conducive to improving water environment quality and achieving sustainable development. This study introduces a comprehensive approach to assessing and analyzing the GWF efficiency. Based on the measurement of the GWF efficiency, the kernel density estimation and the Dagum Gini coefficient method are introduced to investigate the spatial and temporal variation of the GWF efficiency. The Geodetector method is also innovatively used to investigate the internal and external driving forces of GWF efficiency, not only revealing the effects of individual factors, but also probing the interaction between different drivers. For demonstrating this assessment approach, nine provinces in China's Yellow River Basin from 2005 to 2020 are chosen for the study. The results show that: (1) the GWF efficiency of the basin increases from 23.92 yuan/m3 in 2005 to 164.87 yuan/m3 in 2020, showing a distribution pattern of ""low in the western and high in the eastern"". Agricultural GWF is the main contributor to the GWF. (2) The temporal variation of the GWF efficiency shows a rising trend, and the kernel density curve has noticeable left trailing and polarization characteristics. The spatial variation of the GWF efficiency fluctuates upwards, accompanied by a rise in the overall Gini coefficient from 0.25 to 0.28. Inter-regional variation of the GWF efficiency is the primary source of spatial variation, with an average contribution of 73.39%. (3) For internal driving forces, economic development is the main driver of the GWF efficiency, and the interaction of any two internal factors enhances the explanatory power. For external driving forces, capital stock reflects the greatest impact. The interaction combinations with the highest q statistics for upstream, midstream and downstream are capital stock and population density, technological innovation and population density, and industrial structure and population density, respectively.",We would like to express our sincere thanks to the editors and anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions.,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0283199,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Yun; Liu, Yu; Yang, Lihua; Fu, Tianbo","Li, Yun (Business school, Hohai University, Nanjing, China.); Liu, Yu (Business school, Hohai University, Nanjing, China.); Yang, Lihua (Business school, Hohai University, Nanjing, China.); Fu, Tianbo (Business school, Jiangsu Open University, Zhenjiang, China.)",,"Li, Yun (Hohai University); Liu, Yu (Hohai University); Yang, Lihua (Hohai University); Fu, Tianbo ()",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283199&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401242,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics,

There is little evidence regarding the effect of host plants on gall morphology. We hypothesised that the morphology and developmental pattern of galls are different because of the different location of their stimulation, even though two kinds of inducers are close relatives. We observed that horned galls and their leaflets of their host plant, Rhus chinensis required a longer rapid growth stage than fusiform galls and Rhus potaninii leaflets. The distribution of trichomes showed positional dependence. Molecular analysis showed that in the fusiform gall, the target genes that regulate the plastochron of leaflets and serration development were hardly expressed, and CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON-2 may be a key gene that regulates the formation of the horns. In summary, horned and fusiform galls showed a developmental pattern similar to those of their host plant leaflets. We suggest that the inducing site is important in the morphology and development of galls.",We are thankful to the three anonymous reviewers and editors whose comments improved this work.,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0283464,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lu, Qin; Chen, Hang; Zhang, Jinwen; Wang, Weiwei; Cui, Yongzhong; Liu, Juan","Lu, Qin (Research Institute of Highland Forest Science, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Kunming, China.; Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China.); Chen, Hang (Research Institute of Highland Forest Science, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Kunming, China.; The Key Laboratory of Cultivating and Utilization of Resources Insects of State Forestry Administration, Kunming, China.); Zhang, Jinwen (Research Institute of Highland Forest Science, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Kunming, China.); Wang, Weiwei (Research Institute of Highland Forest Science, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Kunming, China.); Cui, Yongzhong (Research Institute of Highland Forest Science, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Kunming, China.); Liu, Juan (Research Institute of Highland Forest Science, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Kunming, China.)",,"Lu, Qin (Chinese Academy of Forestry; Nanjing Forestry University); Chen, Hang (Chinese Academy of Forestry); Zhang, Jinwen (Chinese Academy of Forestry); Wang, Weiwei (Chinese Academy of Forestry); Cui, Yongzhong (Chinese Academy of Forestry); Liu, Juan (Chinese Academy of Forestry)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283464&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401254,31 Biological Sciences; 3108 Plant Biology,

The Fremantle Back Awareness Questionnaire (FreBAQ) is intended to capture alterations in bodily awareness or perception. To date only region-specific (back, neck, shoulder, knee) versions have been published.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to report on the properties of a new region-generic version of the FreBAQ, the FreBAQ-general. Structural validity, internal consistency, and convergent validity against external criteria were evaluated in a sample of Canadian military veterans with chronic pain, with results compared against those published for the region-specific FreBAQ versions.
METHODS: Eligible participants were those that had prior military service, were at least 18 years of age and self-identified as having chronic pain. We used a split-sample approach to Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) on independent random samples. Factor structure, internal consistency, and associations with external criteria were used to compare against prior versions.
RESULTS: 328 respondents (74% of consented) completed at least 7 of the 9 FreBAQ-general questions. EFA and CFA on two independent samples offered support for both 6- and 7-item versions. Comparisons against the external criteria (pain severity, interference, catastrophizing) indicated no statistical superiority of one over the other, so in the interest of parsimony the 6-item FreBAQ-general was endorsed.
CONCLUSIONS: The Fremantle Body Awareness Questionnaire (FreBAQ-general) showed psychometric properties very much in alignment with those previously reported for the region-specific versions, and sound factorial validity accomplished with fewer items (6 vs. 9). We believe this version can be implemented in practice for those seeking a shorter scale without the need to have multiple region-specific versions on hand, though suggest that those seeking direct comparability with previously published work will still wish to use the original versions.","The authors wish to thank Margaret Lomotan, Christina Ziebart, and Katrina Munro for study coordination and support.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0282957,All OA; Gold,Article,"Walton, David M; Nazari, Goris; Bobos, Pavlos; MacDermid, Joy C","Walton, David M (Faculty of Health Science, School of Physical Therapy, Western University, London, ON, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London ON, Canada.); Nazari, Goris (Queens University, Kingston, ON, Canada.); Bobos, Pavlos (Faculty of Health Science, School of Physical Therapy, Western University, London, ON, Canada.); MacDermid, Joy C (Faculty of Health Science, School of Physical Therapy, Western University, London, ON, Canada.; Roth McFarlane Hand and Upper Limb Centre, St. Joseph's Hospital, London, ON, Canada.)",,"Walton, David M (Western University; Western University); Nazari, Goris (Queen's University); Bobos, Pavlos (Western University); MacDermid, Joy C (Western University; St. Joseph's Hospital)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282957&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401238,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,

The purpose of study is to design lumbar supports with different protrusion thicknesses to adjust the load on the operator's lumbar under whole-body vibration. Integrating pressure distribution measurement with subjective assessment, pressure distribution on the contact surface between ten male tractor drivers and the seat under conditions of different lumbar supports and driving speeds and the influence of the presence of lumbar supports and their thickness on the subjects' comfort were analyzed. The results demonstrated that there existed a certain correlation between the pressure distribution indexes and the drivers' subjective evaluation, and the pressure distribution indexes could reflect ride comfort objectively. The 3 cm thick lumbar support did not improve ride comfort significantly, while the 9 cm thick support exerted too much stress on the waist, causing the lumbar spine to lean forward excessively and aggravating lumbar fatigue. Most subjects in the study would prefer to increase the thickness of the lumbar supports to approximately 6 cm. Based on the pressure distribution test, this study conducted an analysis of the influence of lumbar supports in tractors, which could provide a reference design for tractor seats.",The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers those provided helpful comments and suggestions on improving this article.,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0282682,All OA; Gold,Article,"Huang, Qingyang; Jin, Xiaoping; Gao, Mengyu; Guo, Mingyang; Sun, Xiaodong; Wei, Yuning","Huang, Qingyang (College of Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.); Jin, Xiaoping (College of Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.); Gao, Mengyu (College of Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.); Guo, Mingyang (College of Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.); Sun, Xiaodong (College of Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.); Wei, Yuning (College of Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.)",,"Huang, Qingyang (China Agricultural University); Jin, Xiaoping (China Agricultural University); Gao, Mengyu (China Agricultural University); Guo, Mingyang (China Agricultural University); Sun, Xiaodong (China Agricultural University); Wei, Yuning (China Agricultural University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282682&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401228,40 Engineering; 4017 Mechanical Engineering; 42 Health Sciences,

Specifically, we wanted to see if we could see distinct health profiles in the flow of re-admitted Covid-19 patients compared to re-admitted non-Covid-19 controls.
DESIGN: Matched cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Electronic medical records of geriatric patients hospitalised in geriatric clinics in Stockholm, Sweden, between March 2020 and January 2022. Patients readmitted three months after initial admission were selected for the analysis and Covid-19 survivors (n = 895) were compared to age-sex-Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)-matched non-Covid-19 controls (n = 2685).
METHODS: We assessed using binary logistic and Cox regression if a previous Covid-19 infection could be a risk factor for worse health progression indicated by the CCI, hospital frailty risk score (HFRS), mortality and specific comorbidities.
RESULTS: The patients were mostly older than 75 years and, already at baseline, had typically multiple comorbidities. The Covid-19 patients with readmission had mostly had their acute-phase infection in the 1st or 2nd pandemic waves before the vaccinations. The Covid-19 patients did not have worse health after three months compared to the matched controls according to the CCI (odds ratio, OR[95% confidence interval, CI] = 1.12[0.94-1.34]), HFRS (OR[95%CI] = 1.05[0.87-1.26]), 6-months (hazard ratio, HR[95%CI] = 1.04[0.70-1.52]) and 1-year-mortality risk (HR[95%CI] = 0.89[0.71-1.10]), adjusted for age, sex and health at baseline (the CCI and HFRS).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The overall health progression of re-hospitalized geriatric Covid-19 survivors did not differ dramatically from other re-hospitalized geriatric patients with similar age, sex and health at baseline. Our results emphasize that Covid-19 was especially detrimental for geriatric patients in the acute-phase, but not in the later phase.

Bone health may affect gait stability during stair walking. This study investigated the gait biomechanics associated with stair ascent in a group of postmenopausal women in relation to walking speed and bone health, quantified by T-score. Forty-five healthy women (mean (SD) age: 67 (14) years), with bone density ranging from healthy to osteoporotic (T-score range +1 to -3), ascended a custom-made five-step staircase with two embedded force plates, surrounded by 10 motion capture cameras, at their self-selected speed. Multivariate regression analyses investigated the explained variance in gait parameters in relation to stair ascent speed and T-score of each individual. Stair ascent speed was 0.65 (0.1) m·s-1 and explained the variance (R2 = 9 to 47%, P ≤ 0.05) in most gait parameters. T-score explained additional variance in stride width (R2 = 20%, P = 0.014), pelvic hike (R2 = 19%, P = 0.011), pelvic drop (R2 = 21%, P = 0.007) and hip adduction (R2 = 7%, P = 0.054). Increased stride width, and thereby a wider base of support, accompanied by increased frontal plane hip kinematics, could be important strategies to improve dynamic stability during stair ascent among this group of women. These findings suggest that targeted exercises of the hip abductors and adductors, including core trunk musculature, could improve dynamic stability during more challenging locomotor tasks. Balance exercises that challenge base of support could also benefit older women with low bone mineral density who may be at risk of falls.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0283333,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dostan, Ali; Dobson, Catherine A; Vanicek, Natalie","Dostan, Ali (Biomedical Engineering Research Group, School of Engineering, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom.); Dobson, Catherine A (Biomedical Engineering Research Group, School of Engineering, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom.); Vanicek, Natalie (School of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom.)",,"Dostan, Ali (University of Hull); Dobson, Catherine A (University of Hull); Vanicek, Natalie (University of Hull)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283333&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401220,42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science; 4207 Sports Science and Exercise,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The forward-backward translation method was used to develop the Myanmar SOHO-5 version and the final questionnaires were tested on 173 five years old children and their parents for reliability and validity. A single dentist examined the caries experience of the children (Kappa:0.90). The structural validity was assessed through confirmatory factor analysis. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability (1-2 weeks) were evaluated using Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively. The association between SOHO-5 scores and additional global rating questions for child oral health status (convergent validity) and the differences between the total SOHO-5 score of children with caries and children without caries (discriminant validity) were investigated.
RESULTS: A confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit for the one-factor structure of the SOHO-5. Cronbach's alpha coefficient values for internal consistency were 0.82 for the children's report and 0.79 for the parental report. The ICCs were 0.90 and 0.89 for the total scores of the children and parental versions in the test-retest reliability analysis. The total SOHO-5 scores for both reports were significantly associated with the global rating questions except for the 'impact on children's general health' question in the parental report. Furthermore, the Myanmar version discriminated between the children with and without caries experiences (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence that both children and parental reports of the Myanmar SOHO-5 version have good reliability and validity to assess the OHRQoL of 5-year-old children in a Burmese-speaking population.","The authors acknowledge the Dr. Kevin Tompkins (Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University) for English language revisions and Dr. Yutthana Khamnil for confirmatory factor analysis.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0282880,All OA; Gold,Article,"Min, Saw Nay; Duangthip, Duangporn; Gao, Sherry Shiqian; Detsomboonrat, Palinee","Min, Saw Nay (Department of Community Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.); Duangthip, Duangporn (Restorative Dental Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, The University of Hong Kong (HKU), Hong Kong, China.); Gao, Sherry Shiqian (Department of Stomatology, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.); Detsomboonrat, Palinee (Department of Community Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.)",,"Min, Saw Nay (Chulalongkorn University); Duangthip, Duangporn (University of Hong Kong); Gao, Sherry Shiqian (Xiamen University); Detsomboonrat, Palinee (Chulalongkorn University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282880&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401248,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry; 42 Health Sciences,

The reports were compiled by the same institute in a standardized format. We studied frequencies and chi-square pairwise comparisons (P<0.05) for 30 identified ownership factors. Overall (tf1 and tf2), 1,308 ownership factors were mentioned in the reports and reports mentioning ≥5 factors were twice as frequent in tf2 (38%) than tf1 (16%). Our data suggest that nine factors may in particular serve as a warning signal for biting incidents, as these factors were most frequently (≥15%) prevalent in the total of reported cases: having a multiple dog household, a dog reportedly roaming a neighbourhood without an owner, a dog's care tasks being transferred, a short leash and muzzle obligation served to the owner for a dog, an isolated and/ or confined keeping of a dog, a dog owner's (suspected) substance abuse, a dog owner's (suspected) animal abuse, a dog owner aggressing at confiscation of the dog and a dog owner being reported on for antisocial behaviours such as intimidation. Particularly, a dog owner's aggressive or antisocial behaviours and previous obligations to muzzle and short leash a dog (in our dataset often inappropriately adhered to by owners), may indicate that a proportion of owners of confiscated dogs, may not always be willing and/ or capable to guarantee societal safety.

Most members of flower longicorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Lepturinae) feed on nectar and pollen of flowers as adults and wood as larvae. In some lepturines, associations with yeasts are known: female adults possess fungus-storing organs (termed mycetangia) at ovipositors, and larvae also possess such organs (termed mycetomes) in their midguts to carry the associated yeasts. Despite the high diversity of Lepturinae in the world, lepturine-yeast associations, such as the consistency of associated yeasts among the beetle's developmental stages and ecological function of yeast symbionts, have been poorly documented. Here, we investigated the yeast symbiont of the Japanese common lepturine Leptura ochraceofasciata. X-ray computed microtomography revealed that a pair of tube-like, S-shaped mycetangia was located at the basal part of the ovipositor and that a muscle bundle joined the apex of the mycetangium to spiculum ventrale of sternum VIII. All female adults harbored only one yeast species, Scheffersomyces insectosa, in the mycetangia. All larvae harbored S. insectosa exclusively in the mycetomes. Scheffersomyces insectosa was also recovered from surfaces of eggs. Scheffersomyces insectosa assimilated wood-associated sugars including xylose, cellobiose, and xylan in culture. These results suggest the intimate association between L. ochraceofasciata and S. insectosa: S. insectosa is transmitted from the mother to offspring during oviposition and may be related to larval growth in wood.","We thank Taichi Fukumura, Naoya Miyajima, Saki Monji, Kazuki Mori, Fumitaka Nakano, Hanami Suzuki, and Naoki Takabe for help with the field work, Akatsuki Kimura for micro-CT, and Naoki Hijii, Hisashi Kajimura, Junsuke Yamasako, and Nobuhisa Yuzawa for helpful information.

We apply active inference to investigate conceptual disorganization in first-episode schizophrenia. We conceptualize speech production as a decision-making process affected by the latent ""conceptual organization""-as a special case of uncertainty about the causes of sensory information. Uncertainty is both minimized via speech production-in which function words index conceptual organization in terms of analytic thinking-and tracked by a domain-general salience network. We hypothesize that analytic thinking depends on conceptual organization. Therefore, conceptual disorganization in schizophrenia would be both indexed by low conceptual organization and reflected in the effective connectivity within the salience network.
STUDY DESIGN: With 1-minute speech samples from a picture description task and resting state fMRI from 30 patients and 30 healthy subjects, we employed dynamic causal and probabilistic graphical models to investigate if the effective connectivity of the salience network underwrites conceptual organization.
STUDY RESULTS: Low analytic thinking scores index low conceptual organization which affects diagnostic status. The influence of the anterior insula on the anterior cingulate cortex and the self-inhibition within the anterior cingulate cortex are elevated given low conceptual organization (ie, conceptual disorganization).
CONCLUSIONS: Conceptual organization, a construct that explains formal thought disorder, can be modeled in an active inference framework and studied in relation to putative neural substrates of disrupted language in schizophrenia. This provides a critical advance to move away from rating-scale scores to deeper constructs in the pursuit of the pathophysiology of formal thought disorder.",,,Schizophrenia Bulletin,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,49,Supplement_2,s115-s124,All OA; Green,Article,"Limongi, Roberto; Silva, Angelica M; Mackinley, Michael; Ford, Sabrina D; Palaniyappan, Lena","Limongi, Roberto (Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.; Robarts Research Institute, London, ON, Canada.); Silva, Angelica M (Robarts Research Institute, London, ON, Canada.); Mackinley, Michael (Robarts Research Institute, London, ON, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.; Lawson Health Research Institute, London, ON, Canada.); Ford, Sabrina D (Robarts Research Institute, London, ON, Canada.); Palaniyappan, Lena (Robarts Research Institute, London, ON, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.; Lawson Health Research Institute, London, ON, Canada.; Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.; The Brain and Mind Institute, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.; Department of Psychiatry, Douglas Mental Health University Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.)",,"Limongi, Roberto (Western University; Western University); Silva, Angelica M (Western University); Mackinley, Michael (Western University; Western University; Lawson Health Research Institute); Ford, Sabrina D (Western University); Palaniyappan, Lena (Western University; Western University; Lawson Health Research Institute; Western University; Western University; Douglas Mental Health University Institute; McGill University)",1,1,,,https://osf.io/jbtpd/,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156413984,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

However, there is no well-grounded and systematic measure to gauge the intensity of COVID-related disclosure and its plausible impact. Therefore, this study develops and validates various COVID-related disclosure measures. More specifically, using a sample of publicly listed U.S. firms and applying natural language processing (NLP) on 10-K reports, we have developed two types of COVID dictionaries (or COVID-related disclosure measurement tools): (a) overall COVID dictionary (count of all COVID-related words/phrases) and (b) contextual COVID-dictionary (count of COVID related words/phrases preceded or followed by positive, negative tones, or financial constraints words). Subsequently, we have validated both types of COVID dictionaries by investigating their association with corporate liquidity events (e.g., dividend payment, dividend change). We confirm that the overall COVID dictionary effectively predicts a firm's liquidity event. We find similar results for contextual COVID dictionaries with a negative spin (i.e., COVID disclosures with a negative tone or an indication of financial constraints). Our results further show that better-governed firms (e.g., greater board independence, and more female directors) tend to have more COVID-related disclosures, despite the fact that more COVID-related disclosures suppress a firm's market-based stock performance (e.g. Tobin's Q). Our results suggest that better-governed firms prefer greater transparency, even if it may hurt their market performance in the short run.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0283138,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dutta, Shantanu; Kumar, Ashok; Pant, Pushpesh; Walsh, Caolan; Dutta, Moumita","Dutta, Shantanu (Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.); Kumar, Ashok (Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.); Pant, Pushpesh (Operations Department, IMT Hyderabad, Shamshabad, Telangana, India.); Walsh, Caolan (Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.); Dutta, Moumita (Faculty of Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.)",,"Dutta, Shantanu (University of Ottawa); Kumar, Ashok (University of Ottawa); Pant, Pushpesh (); Walsh, Caolan (University of Ottawa); Dutta, Moumita (University of Ottawa)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283138&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401246,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3501 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Studies have shown that the stressors threatening their well-being are multifaceted and include inequalities and a high practical and emotional workload, but research on protective factors is still scarce.
AIM & METHODS: This qualitative descriptive study focuses on both the stressors and factors that promote care workers' well-being and contribute to their psychological resilience. In guideline-based interviews, 14 female and one male care workers were asked about their stressors and the factors that help them cope.
RESULTS: Identified stressors included separation from their own family, strained relationship with either or both the care recipient (dementia) and their relatives (violation of worker´s rights and devaluation of care work), and permanent availability and lack of free time due to a 24-h care schedule. Resilience factors were both external and internal and included positive social relationships, self-determination, experience in care work, and intrinsic job motivation.
CONCLUSION: Live-ins reside in an ambiguous setting, exposed to both structural and individual strains. However, external and internal resilience factors contribute to a generally positive attitude toward their job and indicate the agency of this precariously employed group. A socially anchored appreciation of their work and an officially controlled expansion of free time are mandatory to improve the working conditions of live-in care workers.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0282744,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kriegsmann-Rabe, Milena; Maus, Katja; Hiebel, Nina; Klein, Constantin; Geiser, Franziska","Kriegsmann-Rabe, Milena (Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.); Maus, Katja (Department of Palliative Medicine, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.); Hiebel, Nina (Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.); Klein, Constantin (University of Applied Sciences for Social Work, Education and Nursing, Dresden, Germany.); Geiser, Franziska (Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.)",,"Kriegsmann-Rabe, Milena (University Hospital Bonn); Maus, Katja (University Hospital Bonn); Hiebel, Nina (University Hospital Bonn); Klein, Constantin (); Geiser, Franziska (University Hospital Bonn)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282744&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401235,"32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations",8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Previous studies have suggested that activation of the Nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) receptor (NOPR) reduces locomotor activity and produces a sedation-like effect in rodents. In the present study, we systematically evaluated the efficacy of two NOPR agonists, Ro64-6198 and SR16835, on sleep/wake in rats, mice, and Cynomolgus macaques. We found a profound, dose-related increase in non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep and electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave activity (SWA) and suppression of Rapid Eye Movement sleep (REM) sleep in all three species. At the highest dose tested in rats, the increase in NREM sleep and EEG SWA was accompanied by a prolonged inhibition of REM sleep, hypothermia, and reduced locomotor activity. However, even at the highest dose tested, rats were immediately arousable upon sensory stimulation, suggesting sleep rather than an anesthetic state. NOPR agonism also resulted in increased expression of c-Fos in the anterodorsal preoptic and parastrial nuclei, two GABAergic nuclei that are highly interconnected with brain regions involved in physiological regulation. These results suggest that the N/OFQ-NOPR system may have a previously unrecognized role in sleep/wake control and potential promise as a therapeutic target for the treatment of insomnia.","Research supported by NIH R21 NS113589, R01 AG020584 and R01 HL059658 to T.S.K. and R01 HL150836 to M.R.B. and T.S.K.

It is also a critical player in the regulation of cell size and cell behaviors such as cell aggregation and phototaxis in cyanobacteria, which constitute an important group of prokaryotes for their roles in the ecology and evolution of the Earth. However, c-di-GMP receptors have never been revealed in cyanobacteria. Here, we report the identification of a c-di-GMP receptor, CdgR, from the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7120. Crystal structural analysis and genetic studies demonstrate that CdgR binds c-di-GMP at the dimer interface and this binding is required for the control of cell size in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner. Different functions of CdgR, in ligand binding and signal transmission, could be separated genetically, allowing us to dissect its molecular signaling functions. The presence of the apo-form of CdgR triggers cell size reduction, consistent with the similar effects observed with a decrease of c-di-GMP levels in cells. Furthermore, we found that CdgR exerts its function by interacting with a global transcription factor DevH, and this interaction was inhibited by c-di-GMP. The lethal effect triggered by conditional depletion of DevH or by the production of several point-mutant proteins of CdgR in cells indicates that this signaling pathway plays critical functions in Anabaena. Our studies revealed a mechanism of c-di-GMP signaling in the control of cell size, an important and complex trait for bacteria. CdgR is highly conserved in cyanobacteria, which will greatly expand our understanding of the roles of c-di-GMP signaling in these organisms.","We thank Dr. Yong-Liang Jiang for help with refinement and discussion about protein crystal structures, staff at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility for help in data collection, and Min Wang and Shu-Zhao Jia from the Analysis and Testing Center of Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences for the support in the measurement using Octet Red Instrument.

It has also been hypothesized that plasma exosomal lncRNAs may be used as Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. In this systematic review, we compiled all studies on the subject to evaluate the accuracy of lncRNAs in identifying AD cases through meta-analysis.
METHODS: A PRISMA-compliant systematic search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases for English publications till September 2022. We included all observational studies published which investigated the sensitivity and specificity of various lncRNAs in plasma samples of AD diagnosis. Our search strategy included lncRNA and all the related spelling and abbreviation variations combined with the keyword Alzheimer's disease. Methodological quality was assessed using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-II) tool. The meta-analysis was carried out using the area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity values to assess the accuracy of the identified lncRNAs in AD diagnosis. To account for the predicted heterogeneity of the study, a random-effects model was used. All the statistical analyses and visualizations were conducted using Stata 17.0 software.
RESULTS: A total of seven studies (AD patients = 553, healthy controls = 513) were included in the meta-analysis. Three lncRNAs were upregulated (RNA BACE-AS1, RNA NEAT1, RNA GAS5), and one lncRNA (MALAT1) was downregulated in plasma samples of AD patients. RNA 51A and RNA BC200 were reported to have variable expression patterns. A lncRNA (RNA 17A) was not significantly different between AD and control groups. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values of lncRNAs in identifying AD were (0.74; 95% CI [0.63, 0.82], I2 = 79.2%), (0.88; 95% CI [0.75, 0.94], I2 = 88.9%), and 0.86; 95% CI [0.82, 0.88], respectively. In addition, the pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of the five individual lncRNAs in AD diagnosis was 20.
CONCLUSION: lncRNAs had high accuracy in identifying AD and must be seen as a promising diagnostic biomarker of the disease.","We would like to thank the Clinical Research Development Unit of Tabriz Valiasr Hospital, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran for their assistance in this research.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0281784,All OA; Gold,Article,"Shobeiri, Parnian; Alilou, Sanam; Jaberinezhad, Mehran; Zare, Farshad; Karimi, Nastaran; Maleki, Saba; Teixeira, Antonio L; Perry, George; Rezaei, Nima","Shobeiri, Parnian (Children's Medical Center Hospital, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran.; Network of Immunity in Infection, Malignancy and Autoimmunity (NIIMA), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran.; Research Center for Immunodeficiencies, Pediatrics Center of Excellence, Children's Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.); Alilou, Sanam (School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.); Jaberinezhad, Mehran (Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Clinical Research Development Unit of Tabriz Valiasr Hospital, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.); Zare, Farshad (Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.); Karimi, Nastaran (School of Medicine, Sari Branch, Islamic Azad University, Sari, Iran.); Maleki, Saba (Network of Immunity in Infection, Malignancy and Autoimmunity (NIIMA), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran.; School of Medicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran.); Teixeira, Antonio L (Neuropsychiatry Program, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, United States of America.); Perry, George (Department of Biology and Neurosciences Institute, University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), San Antonio, TX, United States of America.); Rezaei, Nima (Network of Immunity in Infection, Malignancy and Autoimmunity (NIIMA), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran.; Research Center for Immunodeficiencies, Pediatrics Center of Excellence, Children's Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.)",,"Shobeiri, Parnian (Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Universal Scientific Education and Research Network; Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Children's Medical Center); Alilou, Sanam (Iran University of Medical Sciences); Jaberinezhad, Mehran (Tabriz University of Medical Sciences; Tabriz University of Medical Sciences); Zare, Farshad (Tabriz University of Medical Sciences); Karimi, Nastaran (Qaemshahr Islamic Azad University); Maleki, Saba (Universal Scientific Education and Research Network; Guilan University of Medical Sciences); Teixeira, Antonio L (The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston); Perry, George (The University of Texas at San Antonio); Rezaei, Nima (Universal Scientific Education and Research Network; Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Children's Medical Center; Tehran University of Medical Sciences)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281784&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401221,34 Chemical Sciences; 3404 Medicinal and Biomolecular Chemistry,3 Good Health and Well Being

In this study, we describe lifestyle practices, such as dietary pattern, as well as disease phenotype in Asian American children with IBD.
METHODS: We reviewed the records of children with IBD, ages 0 to 21 years old, and race identified as Asian, Indian, or Pacific Islander. Patients who received outpatient IBD care at our center between January 2013 and January 2020 were included. We excluded patients who were international second opinions, who did not have a definitive diagnosis of IBD, and in whom a diagnosis of IBD was made after 18 years of age. A survey, including a food frequency questionnaire adapted from NHANES DSQ with modifications to include culturally appropriate food elements, was designed and conducted within this cohort to assess for dietary patterns.
RESULTS: Asian patients in our cohort have similar phenotypes as non-Asians with few distinctive differences. There was a Crohn's disease and male predominance similar with non-Asians. However, there was a high rate of proctitis in ulcerative colitis in Asian patients. Asian patients reported a typical dietary pattern that reflects a Westernized pattern rather than a traditional pattern. Despite a similar dietary pattern, there was a high rate of 25-OH Vitamin D deficiency (44%) and insufficiency (40%).
CONCLUSIONS: This single center study showed that the phenotype of Asian children with IBD in the U.S. is similar with that of non-Asian with a few distinct differences. The Asian children in our cohort reported following a Westernized dietary pattern and lifestyle. However, there was a high rate of Vitamin D deficiency surrounding diagnosis, suggesting a need for vigilant monitoring.",We would also like to thank the generous IBD families as well as CURE for IBD for their support of the CHOP IBD Center.,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0281949,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zong, Wenjing; Patel, Amit; Chang, Vivian; Mitchel, Elana B; Stoner, Natalie; Baldassano, Robert N; Albenberg, Lindsey","Zong, Wenjing (Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.); Patel, Amit (Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine, Glassboro, New Jersey, United States of America.); Chang, Vivian (Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.); Mitchel, Elana B (Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.); Stoner, Natalie (Division of Clinical Nutrition, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.); Baldassano, Robert N (Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.); Albenberg, Lindsey (Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.)",,"Zong, Wenjing (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia); Patel, Amit (Rowan University); Chang, Vivian (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia); Mitchel, Elana B (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia); Stoner, Natalie (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia); Baldassano, Robert N (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia); Albenberg, Lindsey (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281949&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401223,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3210 Nutrition and Dietetics,

Originally culture-based and then focused 16S sequencing techniques were used, but we have now applied whole metagenomic sequencing to a variety of cleanroom samples at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), including the Spacecraft Assembly Facility (SAF) with the goals of taxonomic identification and for functional assignment. Our samples included facility pre-filters, cleanroom vacuum debris, and surface wipes. The taxonomic composition was carried out by three different analysis tools to contrast marker, k-mer, and true alignment approaches. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the data separated vacuum particles from other SAF DNA samples. Vacuum particle samples were the most diverse while DNA samples from the ISO (International Standards Organization) compliant facilities and the SAF were the least diverse; all three were dominated by Proteobacteria. Wipe samples had higher diversity and were predominated by Actinobacteria, including human commensals Cutibacterium acnes and Corynebacterium spp. Taxa identified by the three methods were not identical, supporting the use of multiple methods for metagenome characterization. Likewise, functional annotation was performed using multiple methods. Vacuum particles and SAF samples contained strong signals of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and of amino acid biosynthesis, suggesting that many of the identified microorganisms have the ability to grow in nutrient-limited environments. In total, 18 samples generated high quality metagenome assembled genomes (MAG), which were dominated by Moraxella osloensis or Malassezia restricta. One M. osloensis MAG was assembled into a single circular scaffold and gene annotated. This study includes a rigorous quantitative determination of microbial loads and a qualitative dissection of microbial composition. Assembly of multiple specimens led to greater confidence for the identification of particular species and their predicted functional roles.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0282428,All OA; Gold,Article,"Highlander, Sarah K; Wood, Jason M; Gillece, John D; Folkerts, Megan; Fofanov, Viacheslav; Furstenau, Tara; Singh, Nitin K; Guan, Lisa; Seuylemezian, Arman; Benardini, James N; Engelthaler, David M; Venkateswaran, Kasthuri; Keim, Paul S","Highlander, Sarah K (Pathogen and Microbiome Division, The Translational Genomics Research Institute, Flagstaff, Arizona, United States of America.); Wood, Jason M (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group, Pasadena, California, United States of America.); Gillece, John D (Pathogen and Microbiome Division, The Translational Genomics Research Institute, Flagstaff, Arizona, United States of America.; Pathogen & Microbiome Institute (PMI), Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, United States of America.); Folkerts, Megan (Pathogen and Microbiome Division, The Translational Genomics Research Institute, Flagstaff, Arizona, United States of America.); Fofanov, Viacheslav (Pathogen & Microbiome Institute (PMI), Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, United States of America.; School of Informatics, Computing and Cyber Systems, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, United States of America.); Furstenau, Tara (Pathogen & Microbiome Institute (PMI), Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, United States of America.); Singh, Nitin K (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group, Pasadena, California, United States of America.); Guan, Lisa (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group, Pasadena, California, United States of America.); Seuylemezian, Arman (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group, Pasadena, California, United States of America.); Benardini, James N (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group, Pasadena, California, United States of America.); Engelthaler, David M (Pathogen and Microbiome Division, The Translational Genomics Research Institute, Flagstaff, Arizona, United States of America.); Venkateswaran, Kasthuri (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Biotechnology and Planetary Protection Group, Pasadena, California, United States of America.); Keim, Paul S (Pathogen and Microbiome Division, The Translational Genomics Research Institute, Flagstaff, Arizona, United States of America.; Pathogen & Microbiome Institute (PMI), Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, United States of America.; Department of Biological Sciences, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, United States of America.)",,"Highlander, Sarah K (Translational Genomics Research Institute); Wood, Jason M (California Institute of Technology); Gillece, John D (Translational Genomics Research Institute; Northern Arizona University); Folkerts, Megan (Translational Genomics Research Institute); Fofanov, Viacheslav (Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University); Furstenau, Tara (Northern Arizona University); Singh, Nitin K (California Institute of Technology); Guan, Lisa (California Institute of Technology); Seuylemezian, Arman (California Institute of Technology); Benardini, James N (California Institute of Technology); Engelthaler, David M (Translational Genomics Research Institute); Venkateswaran, Kasthuri (California Institute of Technology); Keim, Paul S (Translational Genomics Research Institute; Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282428&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401227,37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology; 51 Physical Sciences,

The current investigation identifies and characterizes these patterns among adolescents presenting to an outpatient mental health service in Ontario, Canada. Data come from cross-sectional standardized patient intake assessments from 916 adolescents attending an outpatient mental health program (January 2019-March 2021). Latent profile analysis identified patterns of substance use (alcohol, cannabis, (e-) cigarettes) and emotional and behavioral disorder symptoms. Sociodemographic and clinical correlates of these patterns were examined using multinomial regression. Three profiles were identified including: 1) low substance use and lower frequency and/or severity (relative to other patients in the sample) emotional and behavioral disorder symptoms (26.2%), 2) low substance use with higher emotional and behavioral disorder symptoms (48.2%), and 3) high in both (25.6%). Profiles differed in sociodemographic and clinical indicators related to age, gender, trauma, harm to self, harm to others, and service use. Experiences of trauma, suicide attempts, and thoughts of hurting others increased the odds of adolescents being in the profile high in both substance use and symptoms compared to other profiles. These findings further document the high rates of substance use in adolescents in mental health treatment and the profiles generally map onto three out of four quadrants in the adapted four-quadrant model of concurrent disorders, indicating the importance of assessing and addressing substance use in these settings.","Acknowledgements

To care for older people living in their own homes, female family caregivers play a pivotal role. The current study aimed to explore the actions of female family caregivers and the challenges they faced in taking care of older people living at homes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Belu district, Indonesia. This qualitative study involved twenty female family caregivers, who were recruited using a combination of purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Findings were grouped into two main categories: (i) actions of female family caregivers in taking care of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. These included limiting both visitations of extended family members and older adults' activities outside homes; explaining the virus to older adults and controlling their access to news, social media and smartphones; providing nutrition, supplement and maintaining daily diets; and (ii) challenges they faced in taking care of older adults included excessive fear of contracting COVID-19 and possibility of transmitting it to older people; feeling stressed; tired and overburdened. The study highlights the significant role family caregivers played to protect older people living at home. The findings can inform government to develop intervention programs that address and support the needs of both family caregivers and older people living at home.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0273761,All OA; Gold,Article,"Asa, Gregorius Abanit; Fauk, Nelsensius Klau; Ratu, Melkianus; Dent, Elsa; Ward, Paul Russell","Asa, Gregorius Abanit (Research Centre for Public Health, Equity and Human Flourishing (PHEHF), Torrens University Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.; Sanggar Belajar Alternatif (SALT), Atambua, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia.); Fauk, Nelsensius Klau (Research Centre for Public Health, Equity and Human Flourishing (PHEHF), Torrens University Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.; Institute of Resource Governance and Social Change, Kupang, Indonesia.); Ratu, Melkianus (Program Studi Keperawatan, Universitas Timor, Timor Tengah Utara, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia.); Dent, Elsa (Research Centre for Public Health, Equity and Human Flourishing (PHEHF), Torrens University Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.); Ward, Paul Russell (Research Centre for Public Health, Equity and Human Flourishing (PHEHF), Torrens University Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.)",,"Asa, Gregorius Abanit (Torrens University Australia); Fauk, Nelsensius Klau (Torrens University Australia); Ratu, Melkianus (University of Timor); Dent, Elsa (Torrens University Australia); Ward, Paul Russell (Torrens University Australia)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273761&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401229,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Most of these behaviors involve the remodeling of cell-cell contacts. During epithelial morphogenesis, contractile actomyosin networks remodel cell-cell contacts by shrinking and extending junctions between lateral cell surfaces. However, actomyosin networks not only generate mechanical stresses but also respond to them, confounding our understanding of how mechanical stresses remodel cell-cell contacts. Here, we develop a two-point optical manipulation method to impose different stress patterns on cell-cell contacts in the early epithelium of the Drosophila embryo. The technique allows us to produce junction extension and shrinkage through different push and pull manipulations at the edges of junctions. We use these observations to expand classical vertex-based models of tissue mechanics, incorporating negative and positive mechanosensitive feedback depending on the type of remodeling. In particular, we show that Myosin-II activity responds to junction strain rate and facilitates full junction shrinkage. Altogether our work provides insight into how stress produces efficient deformation of cell-cell contacts in vivo and identifies unanticipated mechanosensitive features of their remodeling.","The project leading to this publication has received funding from France 2030, the French Government program managed by the French National Research Agency (ANR-16-CONV-0001) and from Excellence Initiative of Aix-Marseille University - A*MIDEX, and generic grants, ANR-17-CE13-0032 and ANR-20-CE30-0023.

We investigated the impact of spousal bereavement on medical expenditures and mortality in the general population, emphasizing on age and sex.
METHODS: Data are from a population-based, retrospective cohort study following 924,958 Danish citizens over the age of 65 years, within 2011-2016. Changes in health care expenditures in those who suffer bereavement were compared with time matched changes among those who did not. Mortality hazards were analysed with time to event analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 77,722 (~8.4%) individuals experienced bereavement, 65.8% being females. Among males, bereavement was associated with increase of expenditures the year after, that was 42 Euros per week (95% CI, 36 to 48) larger than the non-bereaved group. The corresponding increase for females was 35 Euros per week (95% CI, 30 to 40). The increase of mortality hazards was highest in the first year after bereavement, higher in males than females, in young old and almost absent in the oldest old. Compared with the reference, mortality the year after spousal loss was 70% higher (HR 1.70 [95% CI 1.40 to 2.08]) for males aged 65-69 years and remained elevated for a period of six years. Mortality for females aged 65-69 years was 27% higher in the first year (HR 1.27, [1.07 to 1.52]), normalizing thereafter.

The objective for this type of data collection, which is not accessible within the standard research context, was to provide a unique dataset, and the opportunity to explore the specific diversity, distribution, seasonality and abundance of many elasmobranch species spread out throughout the territory of French Polynesia. Since the data are based on random citizen observations, the spatial distribution was biased toward the most frequented sites and islands where scuba diving is most developed. Overall, the increase in observed abundance of rays and sharks observed in French Polynesia, and the three most sampled islands as well as the high specific diversity recorded for the region, provide first evidence on the effectiveness of the French Polynesia's Shark Sanctuary, established in 2006. These data, collected randomly by the volunteers, also provide insights into potential movement patterns and site fidelity of some of the more commonly observed species. While no final conclusions can be drawn, it is clear that the network of volunteers that regularly contributes information to the Polynesian Shark Observatory plays a very important role in the delivery of much needed data for conservation and management action, as well as providing perspectives for new directions in research on sharks and rays in French Polynesia.","We deeply thank all the ORP volunteers who were involved in the data reporting.

What remains under appreciated, however, is that some parents appear to be more responsive to interventions to foster skilled parenting than others. Notable in this regard is the ever-increasing observational and, perhaps more importantly, experimental evidence indicating that some children prove more susceptible to parenting interventions than others. So, while the experimental evidence clearly indicates that ""susceptibility factors"" which children carry seem to affect their likelihood of benefiting from a parenting intervention (and other environmental influences), what remains unclear is why the parenting interventions in question prove more effective in changing the behavior of some parents more than others. Could it be as a result of their own parental characteristics?
OBJECTIVE: The Parfective Microtrial in a randomized controlled microtrial, in which we focus not just on parental (and child) responsiveness but also on an underlying physiological mechanism hypothesized to contribute to heightened susceptibility to parenting interventions.
METHODS: Participants are 120 families, with children aged 4-5 years, recruited from the community. Of these, 60 are randomly assigned to the ""micro"" intervention condition (i.e., immediate positive parenting feedback) and 60 families to the care-as-usual control condition. Assessments in both conditions will be conducted at baseline (pretest), after 2 weeks (posttest), and after 4 weeks (follow-up). Primary outcomes are the hypothesized moderating effects of physiology on the anticipated ""micro"" intervention effect (i.e., decrease in negative parenting behavior and/or increase in positive parenting behavior).

Such initiatives dovetail with certain approaches to neighborhood development, such as the EcoDistrict standard for community development, that prioritize both ecologically and socially sustainable neighborhoods. However, healthcare system and community development initiatives can be untethered from the preferences and lived realities of residents in the very neighborhoods upon which they focus. Utilizing the go-along approach to collecting qualitative data in situ, we interviewed 19 adults to delineate residents' community health perspectives and priorities. Findings reveal health priorities distinct from clinical outcomes, with residents emphasizing social connectedness, competing intra- and interneighborhood perceptions that potentially thwart social connectedness, and a neighborhood emplacement of agency, dignity, and self-worth. Priorities of healthcare systems and community members alike must be accounted for to optimize efforts that promote health and social well-being by being valid and meaningful to the community of focus.","CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STATEMENT Dr. Perzynski reports equity ownership in Global Health Metrics, LLC and book royalty agreements with Taylor Francis and Springer Nature, outside the current work.

Despite extensive evidence that topical fluoride is safe and prevents tooth decay, an increasing number of caregivers are hesitant about their children receiving topical fluoride, leading to challenges in clinical settings where caregivers refuse preventive care.
PURPOSE: To explore the determinants of topical fluoride hesitancy for caregivers with dependent children.
METHODS: In this qualitative study, we interviewed 56 fluoride-hesitant caregivers to develop an inductive conceptual model of reasons why caregivers are hesitant.
RESULTS: The core construct of the conceptual model of topical fluoride hesitancy centered on caregivers ""wanting to protect and not mess up their child"". Six domains comprised this core construct: thinking topical fluoride is unnecessary, wanting to keep chemicals out of my child's body, thinking fluoride is harmful, thinking there is too much uncertainty about fluoride, feeling pressured to get topical fluoride, and feeling fluoride should be a choice.
CONCLUSIONS: Topical fluoride hesitancy is complex and multifactorial.

These were exploited by precolonial populations to manufacture wound-wire bangles, other forms of jewelry, and large copper ingots that were used as stores of copper or as forms of prestige. Rectangular, fishtail, and croisette ingots dating between the 5th and 20th centuries CE have been found in many locations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Zambia, and Zimbabwe, with isolated finds in Malawi and Mozambique. Molds for casting these ingots have been found mostly in the Central African Copperbelt, but also around the Magondi Belt copper deposits in northern Zimbabwe. For years, scholars have debated whether these ingots were exclusively made in the Copperbelt or if the molds found in Zimbabwe indicate that local copies were produced from Magondi Belt copper ore (Garlake 1970; Bisson 1976). Before the recent application of lead isotopic and chemical methods to provenance copper in central and southern Africa, there was no way to discern between these hypotheses. Rademakers et al. (2019) and Stephens et al. (2020) showed that copper artifacts from southern DRC (mostly from Upemba) and from northwestern Botswana (Tsodilo Hills) match the lead isotope ratios of ores from the Copperbelt. Building upon these previous studies, we present here the first results from a copper provenance project across the southern third of Africa, from the Copperbelt to northern South Africa. We apply lead isotopic analysis (LIA) and chemical analyses to establish the provenance of 29 croisette ingots recovered in Zimbabwe, 2 fishtail and 1 rectangular ingot recovered from sites in Zambia, and an ""X"" shaped ingot smelted in an experiment in Zambia in the 1970's. Our chemistry and lead isotopic results indicate that 16 of these objects were smelted with copper from the Copperbelt, 16 objects source more specifically to the Kipushi deposit within this geological district, and only one HXR ingot sources to the Magondi Belt in Zimbabwe. Taken together, we clearly illustrate that croisette ingots were traveling significant distances to reach their eventual sites of deposition, and that there was also local production of these objects in Zimbabwe.","We thank the Livingstone Museum and Museum of Human Sciences for granting access to their collections, and the National Heritage Conservation Committee in Zambia and the National Museums and Monuments board of Zimbabwe for permits issued for export and destructive analysis of these samples.

Pneumolysin is one of the main virulence factors produced by all types of pneumococci. This toxin (53 kDa) is a highly conserved protein that binds to cholesterol in eukaryotic cells, forming pores that lead to cell destruction.
METHODS: The databases consulted were MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus. Articles were independently screened by title, abstract, and full text by two researchers, and using consensus to resolve any disagreements that occurred. Articles in other languages different from English, patents, cases report, notes, chapter books and reviews were excluded. Searches were restricted to the years 2000 to 2021. Methodological quality was evaluated using OHAT framework.
RESULTS: Forty-one articles describing the effects of different molecules that inhibit PLY were reviewed. Briefly, the inhibitory molecules found were classified into three main groups: those exerting a direct effect by binding and/or blocking PLY, those acting indirectly by preventing its effects on host cells, and those whose mechanisms are unknown. Although many molecules are proposed as toxin blockers, only some of them, such as antibiotics, peptides, sterols, and statins, have the probability of being implemented as clinical treatment. In contrast, for other molecules, there are limited studies that demonstrate efficacy in animal models with sufficient reliability.
DISCUSSION: Most of the studies reviewed has a good level of confidence. However, one of the limitations of this systematic review is the lack of homogeneity of the studies, what prevented to carry out a statistical comparison of the results or meta-analysis.
CONCLUSION: A panel of molecules blocking PLY activity are associated with the improvement of the inflammatory process triggered by the pneumococcal infection. Some molecules have already been used in humans for other purposes, so they could be safe for use in patients with pneumococcal infections. These patients might benefit from a second line treatment during the initial stages of the infection preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome and invasive pneumococcal diseases. Additional research using the presented set of compounds might further improve the clinical management of these patients.","We acknowledge Dr. Pilar García (IPLA, CSIC, Spain) for critical review of manuscript.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0282970,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cima Cabal, María Dolores; Molina, Felipe; López-Sánchez, José Ignacio; Pérez-Santín, Efrén; Del Mar García-Suárez, María","Cima Cabal, María Dolores (Escuela Superior de Ingeniería y Tecnología (ESIT), Universidad Internacional de La Rioja, UNIR, Logroño, La Rioja, Spain.); Molina, Felipe (Genética, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain.); López-Sánchez, José Ignacio (Escuela Superior de Ingeniería y Tecnología (ESIT), Universidad Internacional de La Rioja, UNIR, Logroño, La Rioja, Spain.); Pérez-Santín, Efrén (Escuela Superior de Ingeniería y Tecnología (ESIT), Universidad Internacional de La Rioja, UNIR, Logroño, La Rioja, Spain.); Del Mar García-Suárez, María (Escuela Superior de Ingeniería y Tecnología (ESIT), Universidad Internacional de La Rioja, UNIR, Logroño, La Rioja, Spain.)",,"Cima Cabal, María Dolores (Universidad Internacional De La Rioja); Molina, Felipe (University of Extremadura); López-Sánchez, José Ignacio (Universidad Internacional De La Rioja); Pérez-Santín, Efrén (Universidad Internacional De La Rioja); Del Mar García-Suárez, María (Universidad Internacional De La Rioja)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282970&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401263,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

The life cycle of the parasite involves two main hosts: a triatomine (arthropod hematophagous vector) and a mammal. Epimastigotes are flagellated forms inside the triatomine gut; they mature in its intestine into metacyclic trypomastigotes, the infective form for humans. Parasites attach despite the shear stress generated by fluid flow in the intestines of the host, but little is known about the mechanisms that stabilize attachment in these conditions. Here, we describe the effect of varying levels of shear stress on attached T. cruzi epimastigotes using a parallel plate flow chamber. When flow is applied, parasites are partially dragged but maintain a connection to the surface via ~40 nm wide filaments (nanotubules) and the activity of flagella is reduced. When flow stops, parasites return near their original position and flagellar motion resumes. Nanotubule elongation increases with increasing shear stress and is consistent with a model of membrane tether extension under force. Fluorescent probes used to confirm membrane composition also show micron-wide anchoring pads at the distal end of the nanotubules. Multiple tethering accounts for more resistance to large shear stresses and for reduced flagellar movement when flow is stopped. The formation of membrane nanotubules is a possible mechanism to enhance adherence to host cells under shear stress, favoring the continuity of the parasite´s life cycle.","We acknowledge the technical assistance of the μ-Core, as well as Elizabeth Suesca for her support in the lab, and Jaime Castro for early experiments.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0283182,All OA; Gold,Article,"Perdomo-Gómez, Cristhian David; Ruiz-Uribe, Nancy E; González, John Mario; Forero-Shelton, Manu","Perdomo-Gómez, Cristhian David (Laboratorio de Ciencias Básicas Médicas, School of Medicine, Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia.; Department of Biological Sciences, Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia.); Ruiz-Uribe, Nancy E (Department of Biological Sciences, Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia.; Department of Physics, Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia.); González, John Mario (Laboratorio de Ciencias Básicas Médicas, School of Medicine, Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia.); Forero-Shelton, Manu (Department of Physics, Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia.)",,"Perdomo-Gómez, Cristhian David (Universidad de Los Andes; Universidad de Los Andes); Ruiz-Uribe, Nancy E (Universidad de Los Andes; Universidad de Los Andes); González, John Mario (Universidad de Los Andes); Forero-Shelton, Manu (Universidad de Los Andes)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283182&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401271,40 Engineering; 4012 Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Engineering,3 Good Health and Well Being

It has been previously shown that the hexagonal arrangement of melanosomes in the distal barbules is responsible for these colors, but previous simulation models have relied on average values for the parameters associated with this arrangement (e.g., periodicity), and it remains to be studied whether the actual (rather than averaged) structural arrangement and its inherent irregularities reliably predict structural color. Previous studies using unmodified images for the analysis have not focused on the effect of such irregularities on the color production. In this study, we conducted finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations using actual transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images obtained from the distal barbules of a magpie tail feather, compared the reflectance spectra predicted using the FDTD simulation with those measured with a spectrometer, and found a substantial discrepancy between the two. Fourier analysis suggests that the non-uniform arrangement of the melanosomes within the barbule is responsible for this discrepancy by creating variation in the periodicity. Our results suggest that a simple model in which the parameters for internal structures are averaged cannot fully explain the variation in the structural colors observed in biological samples such as the feathers of birds.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0282053,All OA; Gold,Article,"Park, Sangkyu; Choi, Jihoon; Kim, Bohyun; Noh, Heeso; Lee, Sang-Im","Park, Sangkyu (Department of Physics, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea.); Choi, Jihoon (Department of Physics, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea.); Kim, Bohyun (Smart Natural Space Research Centre, Kongju National University, Cheonan, South Korea.); Noh, Heeso (Department of Physics, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea.); Lee, Sang-Im (Department of New Biology, DGIST, Daegu, South Korea.)",,"Park, Sangkyu (Kookmin University); Choi, Jihoon (Kookmin University); Kim, Bohyun (Kongju National University); Noh, Heeso (Kookmin University); Lee, Sang-Im (Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282053&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401225,31 Biological Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering,

Unfortunately, these documents are often affected by different age and storage related degradation which impinge on their readability and information contents. In this paper, we propose a document restoration method that removes the unwanted interfering degradation patterns from color ancient manuscripts. We exploit different color spaces to highlight the spectral differences in various layers of information usually present in these documents. At each image pixel, the spectral representations of all color spaces are stacked to form a feature vector. PCA is applied to the whole data cube to eliminate correlation of the color planes and enhance separation among the patterns. The reduced data cube, along with the pixel spatial information, is used to perform a pixel based segmentation, where each cluster represents a class of pixels that share similar color properties in the decorrelated color spaces. The interfering, unwanted classes can thus be removed by inpainting their pixels with the background texture. Assuming Gaussian distributions for the various classes, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is estimated through the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm from the data, and then used to find appropriate labels for each pixel. In order to preserve the original appearance of the document and reproduce the background texture, the detected degraded pixels are replaced based on Gaussian conditional simulation, according to the surrounding context. Experiments are shown on manuscripts affected by different kinds of degradations, including manuscripts from the DIBCO 2018 and 2019 publicaly available dataset. We observe that the use of a few PCA dominant components accelerates the clustering process and provides a more accurate segmentation.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0282142,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hanif, Muhammad; Tonazzini, Anna; Hussain, Syed Fawad; Khalil, Akhtar; Habib, Usman","Hanif, Muhammad (Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, GIK Institute, Topi, Pakistan.; Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione ""Alessandro Faedo"" Area della Ricerca CNR di Pisa, Pisa, Italy.); Tonazzini, Anna (Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione ""Alessandro Faedo"" Area della Ricerca CNR di Pisa, Pisa, Italy.); Hussain, Syed Fawad (School of computer science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.); Khalil, Akhtar (Research and Innovation, iFahja Limited, United Kingdom.); Habib, Usman (Department of AI &; DS, School of Computing, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan.)",,"Hanif, Muhammad (Institute of Information Science and Technologies); Tonazzini, Anna (Institute of Information Science and Technologies); Hussain, Syed Fawad (University of Birmingham); Khalil, Akhtar (); Habib, Usman (National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282142&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401224,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation,

Short telomeres are associated with an increased risk of neurological and psychiatric disorders including dementia. The mechanism underlying this risk is unclear, and may involve brain structure and function. However, the relationship between telomere length and neuroimaging markers is poorly characterized. Here we show that leucocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with multi-modal MRI phenotypes in 31,661 UK Biobank participants. Longer LTL is associated with: i) larger global and subcortical grey matter volumes including the hippocampus, ii) lower T1-weighted grey-white tissue contrast in sensory cortices, iii) white-matter microstructure measures in corpus callosum and association fibres, iv) lower volume of white matter hyperintensities, and v) lower basal ganglia iron. Longer LTL was protective against certain related clinical manifestations, namely all-cause dementia (HR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.91-0.96), but not stroke or Parkinson's disease.

This is a study on misophonia in a large sample, representative of the UK general population. The study utilises a multidimensional psychometric tool, the S-Five, to study the intensity of the triggering misophonic sounds in everyday activities, the emotions/feelings related to them, and the norms of the key components of the misophonic experience: internalising and externalising appraisals, perceived threat and avoidance behaviours, outbursts, and the impact on functioning. Based on the S-Five scores and a semi-structured interview delivered by clinicians who specialise in misophonia, the estimated prevalence of people for whom symptoms of misophonia cause a significant burden in their life in the UK was estimated to be 18%. The psychometric properties of the S-Five in the UK general population were also evaluated and differences across gender and age were explored. Our results show that the five-factor structure is reproduced, and that the S-Five is a reliable and valid scale for the measurement of the severity of the misophonic experience in the general UK population.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0282777,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vitoratou, Silia; Hayes, Chloe; Uglik-Marucha, Nora; Pearson, Oliver; Graham, Tom; Gregory, Jane","Vitoratou, Silia (Biostatistics and Health Informatics Department, Psychometrics and Measurement Lab, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.); Hayes, Chloe (Biostatistics and Health Informatics Department, Psychometrics and Measurement Lab, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.); Uglik-Marucha, Nora (Biostatistics and Health Informatics Department, Psychometrics and Measurement Lab, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.); Pearson, Oliver (Biostatistics and Health Informatics Department, Psychometrics and Measurement Lab, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.); Graham, Tom (Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.); Gregory, Jane (Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Oxford Health Specialist Psychological Interventions Centre, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom.)",,"Vitoratou, Silia (King's College London); Hayes, Chloe (King's College London); Uglik-Marucha, Nora (King's College London); Pearson, Oliver (King's College London); Graham, Tom (South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust); Gregory, Jane (University of Oxford; Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282777&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401276,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 52 Psychology,

But why do citizens contribute to the dissemination of falsehoods online? This article investigates this question by focusing on the role of motivated reasoning and, in particular, perceptions of group-based conflict. It examines the effect of perceived conflict on the endorsement of false news in the context of a regional conflict between Russia and the West as experienced by Ukrainian citizens. In our survey experiment, a sample of Ukrainians (N = 1,615) was randomly assigned to read negative false news stories about Russia, the European Union or Tanzania-a country with no stakes in the conflict. The results show that higher perceived conflict between Ukraine and Russia makes Ukrainians less likely to endorse false news targeting the European Union, but more likely to endorse false news that paint a negative picture of Russia. This finding extends the support for motivated reasoning theory beyond Western contexts investigated so far. Importantly, the effects of conflict perceptions remain strong after controlling for group identity and political knowledge of participants. These results advance our understanding of why false information is disseminated and point to the importance of conflict de-escalation to prevent the diffusion of falsehoods.",We thank Florian van Leeuwen for help with the design of the main study.,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0282308,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mazepus, Honorata; Osmudsen, Mathias; Bang-Petersen, Michael; Toshkov, Dimiter; Dimitrova, Antoaneta","Mazepus, Honorata (Institute of Security and Global Affairs, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands.); Osmudsen, Mathias (Department of Political Science, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.); Bang-Petersen, Michael (Department of Political Science, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.); Toshkov, Dimiter (Institute of Public Administration, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands.); Dimitrova, Antoaneta (Institute of Security and Global Affairs, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands.)",,"Mazepus, Honorata (Leiden University); Osmudsen, Mathias (Aarhus University); Bang-Petersen, Michael (Aarhus University); Toshkov, Dimiter (Leiden University); Dimitrova, Antoaneta (Leiden University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282308&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401274,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4701 Communication and Media Studies","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

However, to date, graph theory tools have not explicitly modelled the semantic content of speech, which is altered in psychosis.
STUDY DESIGN: We developed an algorithm, ""netts,"" to map the semantic content of speech as a network, then applied netts to construct semantic speech networks for a general population sample (N = 436), and a clinical sample comprising patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), people at clinical high risk of psychosis (CHR-P), and healthy controls (total N = 53).
STUDY RESULTS: Semantic speech networks from the general population were more connected than size-matched randomized networks, with fewer and larger connected components, reflecting the nonrandom nature of speech. Networks from FEP patients were smaller than from healthy participants, for a picture description task but not a story recall task. For the former task, FEP networks were also more fragmented than those from controls; showing more connected components, which tended to include fewer nodes on average. CHR-P networks showed fragmentation values in-between FEP patients and controls. A clustering analysis suggested that semantic speech networks captured novel signals not already described by existing NLP measures. Network features were also related to negative symptom scores and scores on the Thought and Language Index, although these relationships did not survive correcting for multiple comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data suggest that semantic networks can enable deeper phenotyping of formal thought disorder in psychosis. Whilst here we focus on network fragmentation, the semantic speech networks created by Netts also contain other, rich information which could be extracted to shed further light on formal thought disorder. We are releasing Netts as an open Python package alongside this manuscript.","Acknowledgments

We sought to identify cross-diagnostic latent factors for speech disturbance with relevance for SSD and computational modeling.
STUDY DESIGN: Clinical ratings for speech disturbance were generated across 14 items for a cross-diagnostic sample (N = 334), including SSD (n = 90). Speech features were quantified using an automated pipeline for brief recorded samples of free speech. Factor models for the clinical ratings were generated using exploratory factor analysis, then tested with confirmatory factor analysis in the cross-diagnostic and SSD groups. The relationships between factor scores and computational speech features were examined for 202 of the participants.
STUDY RESULTS: We found a 3-factor model with a good fit in the cross-diagnostic group and an acceptable fit for the SSD subsample. The model identifies an impaired expressivity factor and 2 interrelated disorganized factors for inefficient and incoherent speech. Incoherent speech was specific to psychosis groups, while inefficient speech and impaired expressivity showed intermediate effects in people with nonpsychotic disorders. Each of the 3 factors had significant and distinct relationships with speech features, which differed for the cross-diagnostic vs SSD groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a cross-diagnostic 3-factor model for speech disturbance which is supported by good statistical measures, intuitive, applicable to SSD, and relatable to linguistic theories. It provides a valuable framework for understanding speech disturbance and appropriate targets for modeling with quantitative speech features.",,,Schizophrenia Bulletin,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,49,Supplement_2,s93-s103,All OA; Green,Article,"Tang, Sunny X; Hänsel, Katrin; Cong, Yan; Nikzad, Amir H; Mehta, Aarush; Cho, Sunghye; Berretta, Sarah; Behbehani, Leily; Pradhan, Sameer; John, Majnu; Liberman, Mark Y","Tang, Sunny X (Institute of Behavioral Science, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Glen Oaks, USA.); Hänsel, Katrin (Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, USA.); Cong, Yan (Institute of Behavioral Science, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Glen Oaks, USA.); Nikzad, Amir H (Institute of Behavioral Science, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Glen Oaks, USA.); Mehta, Aarush (Institute of Behavioral Science, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Glen Oaks, USA.); Cho, Sunghye (Linguistic Data Consortium, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA.); Berretta, Sarah (Institute of Behavioral Science, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Glen Oaks, USA.); Behbehani, Leily (Institute of Behavioral Science, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Glen Oaks, USA.); Pradhan, Sameer (Linguistic Data Consortium, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA.); John, Majnu (Institute of Behavioral Science, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Glen Oaks, USA.); Liberman, Mark Y (Linguistic Data Consortium, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA.)",,"Tang, Sunny X (Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research); Hänsel, Katrin (Yale University); Cong, Yan (Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research); Nikzad, Amir H (Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research); Mehta, Aarush (Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research); Cho, Sunghye (University of Pennsylvania); Berretta, Sarah (Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research); Behbehani, Leily (Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research); Pradhan, Sameer (University of Pennsylvania); John, Majnu (Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research); Liberman, Mark Y (University of Pennsylvania)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.31.22273263,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156413986,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

However, embryo selection raises ethical concerns. Thus, several techniques to select sex-specific spermatozoa have been proposed but carry limitations. There are many variations of each technique, and some are time consuming and costly. Concerns about effectiveness and safety have also rendered many of them unappealing. Therefore, we propose a novel sperm sex selection technique (SST) that appears to be consistently safe and effective. A single-center, non-randomized clinical trial was designed. We included 1,317 couples, who were assigned to one of two groups: ICSI/PGTA or ICSI/PGTA+GS. Ejaculates from male partners of couples in the ICSI/PGTA+GS group (n = 105) were processed using SST to enrich spermatozoa for their desired sex. Standard sperm processing was carried out for couples undergoing PGT-A solely for aneuploidy (n = 1,212), comprising the ICSI/PGTA control group. To validate the efficacy of our technique, we performed an analysis on spermatozoa pre- and post-selection, followed by an assessment of the proportion of the conceptuses' sex to confirm clinical reliability. We also followed up on ICSI clinical outcomes and child/newborn health to establish the safety of our method. Our main outcome measures included the proportion of spermatozoa and embryos enriched for female and male sex, as well as embryo euploidy rates and ICSI clinical outcomes. These outcomes were compared between the two groups. For the ICSI/PGTA group (n = 1,212) (maternal age, 37.0±4yrs; paternal age, 39.1±6yrs), with ejaculated spermatozoa processed in the standard fashion, 2,303 ICSI cycles (1.2±1) yielded an 81.0% (14,375/17,737) fertilization. PGT-A results indicated a euploidy rate of 73.1% (n = 3,718) for female and 72.4% (n = 3,054) for male embryos. These couples achieved a 76.4% (699/915) implantation and 65.2% (597/915) clinical pregnancy rate, with 551 deliveries (48.5% female, 51.5% male). All 105 men in the ICSI/PGTA+GS group had sperm specimens with an equal sex distribution at baseline. Of them, 59 (paternal age, 40.9±6yrs) who desired female offspring obtained an 81.6% enrichment after SST. They underwent 73 ICSI cycles with their partners (maternal age, 37.9±4yrs), achieving a 77.3% (583/754) fertilization. This resulted in 79.1% (231/292) female embryos that generated a 79.3% (23/29) implantation rate, with 16 singleton deliveries of the desired female sex without major or minor congenital malformations. Forty-six couples (maternal age, 37.3±4yrs; paternal age, 40.7±6yrs) desiring male offspring obtained an 80.8% sperm sex enrichment. They underwent 50 ICSI cycles, achieving a 75.4% (462/613) fertilization and equivalent proportion of male embryos (223/280, 79.6%). Their implantation was 90.5% (19/21), with 13 singleton deliveries of healthy male offspring. Furthermore, 78.8% (182/231) of female and 66.4% (148/223) of male embryos from the ICSI/PGTA+GS cohort were euploid. These euploid rates were comparable to those from the ICSI/PGTA group. In couples undergoing ICSI with PGT-A, SST consistently enriched spermatozoa, resulting in a higher proportion of embryos and thus offspring of the desired sex. Moreover, SST did not impair the fertilization or embryo developmental competence of spermatozoa, nor did it affect offspring health.

It also explores whether predictive accuracy of a pre/perinatal model varies for different groups in the population. We used the ABCD (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development) cohort from the United States (N = 9975). Pre/perinatal information and the Child Behavior Checklist were reported by the parent when the child was aged 9-10. Forty variables which are generally known by birth were input as potential predictors including maternal substance-use, obstetric complications and child demographics. Elastic net regression with 5-fold validation was performed, and subsequently stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, household income and parental psychopathology. Seventeen pre/perinatal variables were identified as robust predictors of ADHD symptoms in this cohort. The model explained just 8.13% of the variance in ADHD symptoms on average (95% CI = 5.6%-11.5%). Predictive accuracy of the model varied significantly by subgroup, particularly across income groups, and several pre/perinatal factors appeared to be sex-specific.

In particular, the challenge was to organize high-quality teaching in which students stay on task. Familiarity with technology may have helped to master the situation. However, only few studies so far have examined the quality of digital distance teaching (e.g., cognitive activation) during school closures and its relation to students' learning (e.g., effort investment). Moreover, systematic research concerning the role of familiarity with technology-enhanced teaching and learning acquired during face-to-face teaching is yet lacking. In our study, we used data from 729 ninth graders to investigate how student-observed learning activities when using technology at a distance were related to students' effort in learning in two subjects (mathematics, German). In addition, we examined whether student-perceived cognitive activation mediated this relation. Finally, the sample provides the unique opportunity to examine the role of familiarity, as some of the classes had been randomly equipped with tablet computers one year before the school closures and thus had the opportunity to gain familiarity with using technology in the classroom. Results from structural equation models showed that student-observed learning activities were associated with students’ learning effort in both subjects. Student-perceived cognitive activation mediated this association. Familiarity with face-to-face technology-enhanced teaching gained before the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to be less important for high-quality digital distance teaching. Thus, infrastructural measures, such as equipping schools with digital devices so that teachers and students can familiarize themselves with technology, do not seem to be decisive for high-quality digital (distance) teaching—at least in the case of short-term change from face-to-face to digital distance teaching, as was necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Acknowledgements All authors are members of the LEAD Graduate School Research Network [GSC1028], which was funded within the framework of the Excellence Initiative of the German federal and state governments.

By the age of 5 years, behavioural and cognitive differences between females and males, and functions associated with brain lateralization such as language skills are appearing. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used to quantify fractional anisotropy (FA) within the WM and increasing values correspond to advancing brain development. To investigate the normal features of WM development during early childhood, we gathered a DTI data set of 166 healthy infants (mean 3.8 wk, range 2-5 wk; 89 males; born on gestational week 36 or later) and 144 healthy children (mean 5.4 years, range 5.1-5.8 years; 76 males). The sex differences, lateralization patterns and age-dependent changes were examined using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). In 5-year-olds, females showed higher FA in wide-spread regions in the posterior and the temporal WM and more so in the right hemisphere, while sex differences were not detected in infants. Gestational age showed stronger association with FA values compared to age after birth in infants. Additionally, child age at scan associated positively with FA around the age of 5 years in the body of corpus callosum, the connections of which are important especially for sensory and motor functions. Lastly, asymmetry of WM microstructure was detected already in infants, yet significant changes in lateralization pattern seem to occur during early childhood, and in 5-year-olds the pattern already resembles adult-like WM asymmetry.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Funding: Venla Kumpulainen was supported by the Finnish Medical Foundation and the Finnish Cultural Foundation.

Little is known about patient-related and VR-related factors affecting efficacy of VR. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed including 122 randomised controlled trials (9138 patients), reporting on subjectively reported pain scores comparing an immersive VR intervention to a non-VR control group. Virtual reality significantly reduced pain in the pooled analysis (standardized mean difference = -0.65, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.54, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences between type of pain, ie, VR effects were similar in acute, chronic, and procedural pain conditions. Univariate and multivariate meta-regression analyses were performed to investigate the effect of intervention, patient, and pain characteristics on VR. Virtual reality effectively reduced pain, especially in patients reporting moderate to severe pain and in younger subjects. Studies comparing VR with a control group receiving no distraction methods were associated with higher effect sizes. The effect of VR was not related to a specific frequency or duration of use. Type of software and interaction level were related to VR effects in the univariable, but not in the multivariable, meta-regression analysis. Heterogeneity was considerable for all meta-analyses, and risk of bias was moderate to high in most included studies. Studies on mechanisms behind VR analgesia in younger patients and patients reporting moderate to severe pain are recommended to confirm our hypotheses while taking into account risk of bias and the comparator. Optimal application of VR using treatment modules for long-term pain conditions are an important issue for future research.",,,Pain,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,Publish Ahead of Print,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Lier, Elisabeth J; de Vries, Marjan; Steggink, Eline M; Ten Broek, Richard P G; van Goor, Harry","Lier, Elisabeth J (Department of Surgery, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.); de Vries, Marjan (); Steggink, Eline M (); Ten Broek, Richard P G (); van Goor, Harry ()",,"Lier, Elisabeth J (Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre); de Vries, Marjan (); Steggink, Eline M (); Ten Broek, Richard P G (); van Goor, Harry ()",0,0,,,https://journals.lww.com/pain/Fulltext/9900/Effect_modifiers_of_virtual_reality_in_pain.268.aspx,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156376282,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,

To generate clinically relevant and widely applicable findings, such trials aim to reproduce elements of routine clinical care or are embedded within clinical workflows. In contrast with traditional efficacy trials, pragmatic trials are intended to address a broader set of external validity questions critical for stakeholders (clinicians, healthcare leaders, policymakers, insurers, and patients) in considering the adoption and use of evidence-based treatments in daily clinical care. This article summarizes methodological considerations for pragmatic trials, mainly concerning methods of fundamental importance to the internal validity of trials. The relationship between these methods and common pragmatic trials methods and goals is considered, recognizing that the resulting trial designs are highly dependent on the specific research question under investigation. The basis of this statement was an Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) systematic review of methods and a consensus meeting. The meeting was organized by the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION) public-private partnership. The consensus process was informed by expert presentations, panel and consensus discussions, and a preparatory systematic review. In the context of pragmatic trials of pain treatments, we present fundamental considerations for the planning phase of pragmatic trials, including the specification of trial objectives, the selection of adequate designs, and methods to enhance internal validity while maintaining the ability to answer pragmatic research questions.",,,Pain,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,Publish Ahead of Print,,,All OA;

A qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Climate change is impacting the health of individuals worldwide. At the same time, the healthcare sector contributes to carbon emissions. In Australia, healthcare contributes 7% of the country's carbon footprint. Research into the environmental impact and mitigation of carbon emissions in primary care is an emerging area.
OBJECTIVE: To explore staff perspectives on facilitators and barriers to environmental sustainability in 3 Australian general practices seeking to reduce their environmental impact.
METHODS: We used a qualitative, case-study approach, conducting 23 semistructured interviews with staff across the 3 practices including nurses, administrative staff, and doctors. Observation of systems and staff behaviour relating to environmental sustainability was undertaken at 1 practice. Thematic analysis was conducted to determine themes relating to factors influencing the implementation of environmentally sustainable initiatives within practice settings.
RESULTS: Climate mitigation efforts raised by participants were largely focussed on energy and waste reduction, rather than prescribing pharmaceuticals and staff and patient transport. Three main factors influencing change towards sustainable practice were identified: ""Leadership,"" ""Staff Engagement and Workplace Culture,"" and ""Concomitant Benefits."" A leadership team and workplace culture that valued environmental sustainability were found to be important facilitators, as were concomitant benefits, in particular financial savings. Barriers included what interviewees described as a lack of knowledge about initiatives with the highest impact, lack of understanding described by staff of the evidence behind particular initiatives, waning staff engagement and infection control concerns.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research highlights several important factors that contribute to the implementation of intended environmentally sustainable initiatives in these 3 practices. Further education, research and high-level policy guidance on the potential environmental impact of prescribing pharmaceuticals, staff and patient transport and unnecessary tests and treatments are recommended to further promote environmental sustainability in primary care.",,,Family Practice,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Pavli, Alex; Loblay, Victoria; Rychetnik, Lucie; Usherwood, Tim","Pavli, Alex (Speciality of General Practice, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Sydney North Health Network, Chatswood, NSW, Australia.); Loblay, Victoria (The Australian Prevention Partnership Centre, Sax Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Menzies Centre for Health Policy and Economics, Sydney School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Youth Mental Health and Technology Team, Brain and Mind Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.); Rychetnik, Lucie (The Australian Prevention Partnership Centre, Sax Institute, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; School of Public Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.); Usherwood, Tim (Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; The George Institute for Global Health, Sydney, NSW, Australia.)",,"Pavli, Alex (The University of Sydney); Loblay, Victoria (Sax Institute; The University of Sydney; The University of Sydney); Rychetnik, Lucie (Sax Institute; The University of Sydney); Usherwood, Tim (The University of Sydney; George Institute for Global Health)",0,0,,,https://academic.oup.com/fampra/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/fampra/cmad027/49597906/cmad027.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156414559,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 13 Climate Action

Evidence-based interventions, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Diabetes Prevention Program and diabetes self-management education and support programs, can help prevent, delay, or manage the disease. However, participation is suboptimal, especially among populations who are at an increased risk of developing diabetes. Evaluations of programs reaching populations who are medically underserved or people with lower incomes can help elucidate how best to tailor evidence-based interventions, but it is also important for evaluations to account for cultural and contextual factors. Culturally responsive evaluation (CRE) is a framework for centering an evaluation in the culture of the programs being evaluated. We integrated CRE with implementation and outcome constructs from the Adapted Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to ensure that the evaluation produced useful evidence for putting evidence-based diabetes interventions to use in real-world settings, reaching populations who are at an increased risk of developing diabetes. The paper provides an overview of how we integrated CRE and CFIR approaches to conduct mixed-methods evaluations of evidence-based diabetes interventions.",,,Prevention Science,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Jacobs, Sara R; Glasgow, LaShawn; Amico, Peter; Farris, Kimberly D; Rutledge, Gia; Smith, Bryce D","Jacobs, Sara R (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.); Glasgow, LaShawn (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.); Amico, Peter (Amico Consulting, Orlando, FL, USA.); Farris, Kimberly D (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.

This question has received a lot of attention within present-day philosophy of psychiatry, where many authors debate the ontology and nature of mental disorders. Similarly, historians of psychiatry, dating back to Foucault, have debated whether psychiatric researchers conceived of mental disorders as natural kinds or not. However, historians of psychiatry have paid little to no attention to the influence of (a) theories within logic, and (b) theories within metaphysics on psychiatric accounts of proper method, and on accounts of the nature and classification of mental disorders. Historically, however, logic and metaphysics have extensively shaped methods and interpretations of classifications in the natural sciences. This paper corrects this lacuna in the history of psychiatry, and demonstrates that theories within logic and metaphysics, articulated by Christian Wolff (1679-1754), have significantly shaped the conception of medical method and (psychiatric) nosology of the influential nosologist Boissier De Sauvages (1706-1767). After treating Sauvages, I discuss the method of the influential nosologist William Cullen (1710-1790), and demonstrate the continuity between the classificatory methods of Sauvages and Cullen. I show that both Sauvages and Cullen were essentialists concerning medical diseases in general and psychiatric disorders in particular, contributing to the history of conceptions of the ontology and nature of mental disorders.",,,History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-06,45,2,12,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"van den Berg, Hein","van den Berg, Hein (Department of Philosophy, Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, , University of Amsterdam, Oude Turfmarkt 143, Postbus 94201 , 1090 GE, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

However, the exact representational content of these modules is still under debate. While there is ample evidence for a distinction between modalities (e.g., visual, auditory perception), the representational content of the modules might even be distinguished by features within the same modalities (e.g., location, color, and shape within the visual modality). In implicit sequence learning, there is evidence for the latter hypothesis, as a stimulus-color sequence can be learned concurrently with a stimulus-location sequence. Our aim was to test whether this also holds true for non-spatial features within the visual modality. This has been shown in artificial grammar learning, but not yet in implicit sequence learning. Hence, in Experiment 1, we replicated an artificial grammar learning experiment of Conway and Christiansen (2006) in which participants were supposed to learn color and shape grammars concurrently. In Experiment 2, we investigated concurrent learning of sequences with an implicit sequence learning paradigm: the serial reaction time task. Here, we found evidence for concurrent learning of two sequences, a color and shape sequence. Overall, the findings converge to the assumption that implicit learning might be based on features.",,,Psychological Research,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Wilts, Sarah; Haider, Hilde","Wilts, Sarah (Department of Psychology, University of Cologne, Richard-Strauss-Str. 2, 50931, Cologne, Germany. swilts3@uni-koeln.de.); Haider, Hilde (Department of Psychology, University of Cologne, Richard-Strauss-Str. 2, 50931, Cologne, Germany.)",,"Wilts, Sarah (University of Cologne); Haider, Hilde (University of Cologne)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-023-01810-2,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156414283,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,

Real-time field observations in nursing homes.,"BACKGROUND: Although published studies have examined the perceptions of caregivers who are attending to older adults with dementia concerning the values of human dignity and/or autonomy in institutional settings, none have explored the possible differences in actual behavior that relates to these values for caregivers from diverse ethno-cultural backgrounds.
AIMS: Explore how caregivers with varied cultural backgrounds may differ in their real-time behavior regarding the autonomy and dignity of older adults with dementia and thereby determine whether that real-time behavior reveals new aspects of respect and disrespect for both the autonomy and dignity of those older adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative research based on non-participatory observations, was meticulously recorded using a written journal and a rigorous microanalysis to analyze the collected data. We made 58 shift-based observations (morning and evening) of 29 caregivers from 3 ethno-cultural groups working in 3 nursing homes in Israel. These groups included Israeli-born Jews (Sabras), Israeli Arab-Muslims (Arabs), and immigrants from the Former Soviet Union (IFSU).
RESULTS: (1) IFSU caregivers demonstrated more respect for autonomy and dignity, but also demonstrated disrespect for these values. (2) the main difference between the IFSU caregivers and other caregiver groups pertained to respect for their autonomy. The main specific facets of autonomy where IFSU caregivers surpassed their colleagues were information provision and persuasion. (3) toward both autonomy and dignity of these older adults, previously unaccounted for in the models we used, were discovered among the varied groups of caregivers, with only minor gaps between these groups.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This study-the first of its kind to focus on the real-time behaviors of caregivers from diverse ethno-cultural backgrounds-reveals the potential effects of culture on applying practices related to dignity and autonomy during daily care. The findings may have important implications for caregiver training in multicultural societies.",,,Dementia,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,,,14713012231158410,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Kaplan, Felix; Bentwich, Miriam Ethel","Kaplan, Felix (School of Social Work, 61315Zefat Academic College, Israel.); Bentwich, Miriam Ethel (Azrieli Faculty of Medicine, 287937Bar-Ilan University, Tzfat, Israel.)",,"Kaplan, Felix (); Bentwich, Miriam Ethel ()",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/14713012231158410,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156413874,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,

However, long-term prospective studies investigating stress-induced eating and drinking in parallel and their relationships with weight are scarce.
PURPOSE: We examined the prevalence of stress-induced eating and drinking and their associations with body mass index (BMI) among women and men during a 30-year follow-up, as well as BMI trajectories from early adulthood to middle age.
METHODS: Participants of a Finnish cohort study were followed by questionnaires at the ages of 22 (N = 1656), 32 (N = 1471), 42 (N = 1334), and 52 (N = 1160). Their coping methods were evaluated by asking how common it was for them to act in certain ways when they encountered stressful situations. We used linear regression analysis to examine the associations between coping methods and BMI, and latent growth models to analyze the BMI trajectories.
RESULTS: The prevalence of stress-induced eating was higher among women than men throughout the follow-up, whereas stress-induced drinking was more common among men at 22 and 32 years of age. Stress-induced eating was associated with higher BMI at all ages among women, and from the age of 32 among men. Eating as a persistent coping method over the life course was associated with a higher and faster growth rate of BMI trajectories. Stress-induced drinking was associated with higher BMI in middle age, and with a faster growth of BMI among men.

If people experience threats to this freedom, for example, by pro-vaccination media campaigns or government pressure, psychological reactance may be induced. To regain freedom, the opposite behaviour (vaccine refusal) may become more attractive, forming a vaccination barrier. It remains unclear how state reactance fluctuates and how it relates to vaccination intention versus behaviour. Therefore, this pre-registered longitudinal study aimed to gain insight in the changes in state reactance during a COVID-19 vaccination programme and its relationship with vaccine uptake.
METHODS: A representative sample of Dutch adults under 60 completed questionnaires before being eligible for vaccination, shortly before they were invited for vaccination, and after the opportunity for vaccination.
RESULTS: Data were analysed using regression analyses (N = 1411). Reactance did not change as hypothesised, but remained stable over time. As hypothesised, reactance predicted lower subsequent vaccination intention. Controlling for intentions, however, reactance did not predict vaccine uptake. Furthermore, reactance predicted lower decision confidence about vaccination, except for people who strongly opposed vaccination.
CONCLUSION: Reactance has a sustained role in anticipation of a vaccination decision. Although reactance seems to affect the process towards the decision, this does not determine the final choice.",,,Psychology and Health,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,,,1-21,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Verpaalen, Iris A M; Ritter, Simone M; van Hooff, Madelon L M; van Stekelenburg, Aart; Fransen, Marieke L; Holland, Rob W","Verpaalen, Iris A M (Behavioural Science Intitute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.); Ritter, Simone M (Institute for Management Research, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.); van Hooff, Madelon L M (Behavioural Science Intitute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.; Faculty of Psychology, Open Universiteit, Heerlen, The Netherlands.); van Stekelenburg, Aart (Behavioural Science Intitute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.); Fransen, Marieke L (Behavioural Science Intitute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.); Holland, Rob W (Behavioural Science Intitute, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.)",,"Verpaalen, Iris A M (Radboud University Nijmegen); Ritter, Simone M (Radboud University Nijmegen); van Hooff, Madelon L M (Radboud University Nijmegen; Open University in the Netherlands); van Stekelenburg, Aart (Radboud University Nijmegen); Fransen, Marieke L (Radboud University Nijmegen); Holland, Rob W (Radboud University Nijmegen)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2023.2190761,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156413863,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 52 Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

Age-related changes in CBF are associated with increased risk of neurocognitive disorders and vascular events such as stroke. Identifying correlates and positive modifiers of age-related changes in CBF before the emergence of incipient clinical decline may inform public health advice and clinical practice. Former research has been inconclusive regarding the association between regular physical activity and CBF, and there is a lack of studies on the association between level of everyday activities and CBF, in older adults. To investigate these relationships, 118 healthy community-dwelling adults (65-89 years) underwent pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI, neurocognitive, physical, and activity assessments at baseline. Eighty-six participants completed a follow-up ASL MRI, on average 506 (SD = 113) days after the baseline scan. Cross-sectional analysis revealed credible evidence for positive associations between time spent on low intensity physical activity and CBF in multiple cortical and subcortical regions, time spent on moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity and accumbens CBF, participation in social activity and CBF in multiple cortical regions, and between reading and thalamic CBF, indicating higher regional CBF in more active adults. Longitudinal analysis revealed anecdotal evidence for an interaction between time and baseline level of gardening on occipital and parietal CBF, and baseline reading on pallidum CBF, indicating more change in CBF in adults with lower level of activity. The findings support that malleable lifestyle factors contribute to healthy brain aging, with relevance for public health guidelines.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are very thankful to those who participated in the StrokeMRI study.

We tested a three-way interaction between emotional reactivity, maladaptive cognitive regulation strategies, and body regard predicting NSSI frequency.
METHODS: Two thousand sixty-six undergraduate students (Mage  = 20.38; 72.4% identified as female; 91.7% White; 22.7% with NSSI) completed measures of emotion reactivity, maladaptive cognitive regulation strategies, body regard, and lifetime NSSI frequency.
RESULTS: The three-way interaction between emotion reactivity, maladaptive cognitive regulation strategies, and body regard was significant. The interaction effect of emotional reactivity and maladaptive cognitive regulation strategies on NSSI was significant when body regard was low but not significant at average and high levels of body regard. The highest NSSI frequency was reported by those high in emotion reactivity and maladaptive cognitive regulation strategies, and low in body regard.
CONCLUSION: These results support the emotional cascade theory of NSSI, and support assertions that body regard might act as a protective barrier against NSSI in the context of heightened emotion reactivity and maladaptive cognitive regulation strategies.",,,Journal of Clinical Psychology,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Myntti, Warner W.; Muehlenkamp, Jennifer J.","Myntti, Warner W.

Chlorogenic acid (CGA), one of the major phenolic acids in Taraxacum officinale, has natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in various cell types; however, the effects of CGA on Lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-induced bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) have not been investigated. In this study, the CGA content in T. officinale was determined by High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). BMECs were infected with LTA to induce the mastitis model. Different concentrations of CGA were administered after establishing the LTA infection. The results showed that the T. officinale contained CGA 1.36 mg/g. CGA significantly reduced the pro-inflammatory gene and protein expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. In addition, CGA downregulated the NO, TLR2, and NF-κB signaling pathways in LTA-infected bovine mammary epithelial cells. Our results indicate that CGA reduced the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and TLR2 by inhibiting the phosphorylation of proteins in the NF-κB signaling pathways in a dose-dependent manner. This finding suggests that CGA may be a potential agent for the treatment of mastitis in dairy cows.",We thank LetPub (www.letpub.com) for its linguistic assistance during the preparation of this manuscript.,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0282343,All OA; Gold,Article,"Xu, Ping; Xu, Xiaobo; Fotina, Hanna; Fotina, Tetiana","Xu, Ping (School of Life Science and Basic Medicine, Xinxiang University, Xinxiang, China.; Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Sumy National Agrarian University, Sumy, Ukraine.); Xu, Xiaobo (School of Life Science and Basic Medicine, Xinxiang University, Xinxiang, China.); Fotina, Hanna (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Sumy National Agrarian University, Sumy, Ukraine.); Fotina, Tetiana (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Sumy National Agrarian University, Sumy, Ukraine.)",,"Xu, Ping (Xinxiang University; Sumy National Agrarian University); Xu, Xiaobo (Xinxiang University); Fotina, Hanna (Sumy National Agrarian University); Fotina, Tetiana (Sumy National Agrarian University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282343&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401273,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology",

This allows minorities to live the life that they want, despite the disapproval. However, the undercurrent of disapproval which comes with tolerance might carry unintended negative consequences for tolerated minorities. The present research utilizes a novel experimental method to give participants an experience of being tolerated to address two key questions: 1) what are the consequences of being tolerated on personal well-being? 2) how does the experience of being tolerated affect future expectations and willingness to raise one's voice? Across four studies with American and Dutch participants (N = 1,758), we find that being tolerated leads to less positive outcomes on well-being than being accepted (although more positive implications relative to being rejected). Further, being tolerated reduces the expectation of being valued in future encounters while simultaneously tamping down on people's willingness to raise their voice against those who begrudgingly include them.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0282073,All OA; Gold,Article,"Adelman, Levi; Yogeeswaran, Kumar; Verkuyten, Maykel","Adelman, Levi (ERCOMER, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.); Yogeeswaran, Kumar (School of Psychology, Speech and Hearing, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.); Verkuyten, Maykel (ERCOMER, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.)",,"Adelman, Levi (Utrecht University); Yogeeswaran, Kumar (University of Canterbury); Verkuyten, Maykel (Utrecht University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282073&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401251,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,

Disrespectful care affects women's childbirth experience and birth outcomes.
METHODS: This study used a descriptive qualitative design to obtain thick and rich data on disrespect and abuse in maternity care in a low-resource setting in Tanzania. Three days workshop was conducted at the Aga Khan University comprising maternity healthcare providers from diverse settings. The workshop was designed based on the existing evidence and anecdotal data and inspired by the authors' experiences of disrespectful and abusive care (stereotyping clients, not listening to client's/relatives' concerns, unconsented care) as a client, relative, or observant of colleagues. The targeted audience was maternity healthcare providers from public and private health facilities in the Dar es Salaam region. Data collection encompassed individual responses (reflection of practice) obtained by individuals, anonymously written reflections of practice, and compiled notes from group discussions. Data were analysed thematically guided by six steps described by Braun and Clerk.
RESULTS: A total of 80 maternity healthcare providers participated in the workshop from various health facilities, including dispensaries (n = 25), health centres (n = 2), and hospitals (n = 3) located in semi-urban Dar es Salaam. Four main themes were identified from the data: Physical and verbal abuse; Lack of professional ethics and integrity; Vulnerable working environment; Abuse and disrespect to care providers. In addition, several sub-themes were identified within these themes: Harsh and abusive language; Beating/slapping/pinching of the mother in labor; notably, Junior midwives also disrespected and abused women; Lack of privacy and confidentiality; Poor communication; No consent for maternity healthcare procedures; Lack of courtesy and poor interpersonal skills; and, negligence of care and woman's needs.
CONCLUSION: The actions of disrespect and abuse are alarming in practice and are associated with ignorance of fundamental human rights by both providers and recipients of services. Conducting workshops seems a useful approach to revealing disrespect and abuse deep-rooted in practice and provides an opportunity to rectify the problem with providers. A more extensive interventional study will be crucial to address the widespread actions of disrespect and abuse.","We extend our sincere appreciation to the Aga Khan University leadership for the guidance and support with running the workshops, to the Dar es Salaam Regional Medical Officer and the Reginal Nursing Officer for their cooperation and for granting permission to their staff to attend the workshop and participate in this study.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0281349,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mwasha, Loveluck K; Kisaka, Lucy M; Pallangyo, Eunice S","Mwasha, Loveluck K (The Aga Khan University- School of Nursing and Midwifery, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.); Kisaka, Lucy M (The Aga Khan University- School of Nursing and Midwifery, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.); Pallangyo, Eunice S (The Aga Khan University- School of Nursing and Midwifery, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.)",,"Mwasha, Loveluck K (Aga Khan University); Kisaka, Lucy M (Aga Khan University); Pallangyo, Eunice S (Aga Khan University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281349&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401247,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4204 Midwifery; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being; 5 Gender Equality

This study investigated associations between single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the IL33 gene and in the IL1RL1 (ST2) gene with periodontitis. Additionally, aimed to determine the role of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) relative amount in the subgingival biofilm in these associations. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 506 individuals that answered a structured questionnaire used to collect their health status, socioeconomic-demographic, and behavioral characteristics. Periodontal examination was performed to determine the presence and severity of periodontitis, and subgingival biofilm samples were collected to quantify the relative amount of Aa by real time polymerase chain reaction. Human genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood cells and SNV genotyping was performed. Logistic regression estimated the association measurements, odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence interval (95%CI), between the IL33 and ST2 genes with periodontitis, and subgroup analyses assessed the relative amount of Aa in these associations. 23% of individuals had periodontitis. Adjusted measurements showed a statistically significant inverse association between two SNVs of the ST2; rs148548829 (C allele) and rs10206753 (G allele). These two alleles together with a third SNV, the rs11693204 (A allele), were inversely associated with moderate periodontitis. One SNV of the IL33 gene also showed a statistically significant inverse association with moderate periodontitis. Nine SNVs of the ST2 gene were inversely associated with the relative amount of Aa. In the high Aa subgroup, there was a direct association between 11 SNVs of the ST2 gene and moderate periodontitis and two SNVs of the ST2 gene and severe periodontitis, and eight SNVs of the ST2 gene and periodontitis. These exploratory findings of genetic variants in IL-33/ST2 axis support the concept that the different tissue responses among individuals with periodontitis may be modulated by the host's genetics, influencing the physiopathology of the disease.","The authors are sincerely grateful to the technical staff of the Laboratory of Immunology of Health Sciences Institute of Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil; and to the Programa para o Controle da Asma e Rinite Alérgica na Bahia (ProAR), Salvador, Brazil.

It is the largest mass of lymphoid tissues in the body and makes up more than 70% immune cells of entire body. GALT is considered to be the origin of systemic mucosal immunity and consists of solitary lymphoid nodules, aggregated lymphoid nodules (Peyer's patches, PPs), scattered lymphoid tissues, and follicular associated epithelia. PPs play important roles as antigen inductive sites of the mucosal immune system, which are mainly distributed in the intestine of animals and humans (especially ileum and appendix). However, a special area of well-developed aggregated lymphoid nodules in the abomasum of Dromedary camel was found in our laboratory. Its existence was rarely described in the stomach before. In the present study, we investigated this special structure with the dromedary camels of different ages (young, 0.5-2 years; pubertal, 3-5 years; middle-aged, 6-16 years; old, 17-20 years), by the anatomical, histological and immunohistochemical approaches. The results showed that the special structure was mainly distributed in the cardiac glandular area of the abomasum, forming a triangular area. The mucosal folds in this area were significantly thicker than those in the surrounding region. These mucosal folds had two different forms, namely reticular mucosal folds (RMF) and longitudinal mucosal folds (LMF). There were abundant lymphoid nodules in the submucosa of RMF and LMF, which were arranged in one or multiple rows. The statistical analysis of the height and thickness of RMF and LMF showed that the structure was most developed in pubertal dromedary camels. The histological characteristics of the structure were the same as PPs in the intestine of the Dromedary camel, while anatomical appearance showed some difference. The immunohistochemical examination revealed that both immunoglobulin A (IgA) and G (IgG) antibodies-producing cells (APCs) were extensively distributed in the gastric lamina propria (LP) in all age group. Our finding suggest that camel stomach not only performs digestive functions, but also involves parts of body immunity.","We are grateful to professor Haider Ibrahim and Dr. Murtada mahgoub (College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bahri, Sudan) for their support during the specimens and samples collection.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0279417,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hassan Omer, Zubieda Ibrahim; Lu, Jia; Cheng, Yu-Jiao; Li, Pei-Xuan; Chen, Zhi-Hua; Wang, Wen-Hui","Hassan Omer, Zubieda Ibrahim (Department of pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, China.); Lu, Jia (Department of pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, China.); Cheng, Yu-Jiao (Department of pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, China.); Li, Pei-Xuan (Department of pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, China.); Chen, Zhi-Hua (Department of pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, China.); Wang, Wen-Hui (Department of pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, China.)",,"Hassan Omer, Zubieda Ibrahim (Gansu Agricultural University); Lu, Jia (Gansu Agricultural University); Cheng, Yu-Jiao (Gansu Agricultural University); Li, Pei-Xuan (Gansu Agricultural University); Chen, Zhi-Hua (Gansu Agricultural University); Wang, Wen-Hui (Gansu Agricultural University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0279417&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401243,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3009 Veterinary Sciences",

In this paper, the dataset for Trucks Involved in Fatal Accidents in 2010 (TIFA 2010) is utilized to classify the truck-involved crash severity where there exist different issues including missing values, imbalanced classes, and high dimensionality. First, a decision tree-based algorithm, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and the Random Forest (RF) feature importance approach are employed for missing value imputation, minority class oversampling, and dimensionality reduction, respectively. Afterward, a variety of classification algorithms, including RF, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are developed to reveal the influence of the introduced data preprocessing framework on the output quality of ML classifiers. The results show that the GBDT model outperforms all the other competing algorithms for the non-preprocessed crash data based on the G-mean performance measure, but the RF makes the most accurate prediction for the treated dataset. This finding indicates that after the feature selection is conducted to alleviate the computational cost of the machine learning algorithms, bagging (bootstrap aggregating) of decision trees in RF leads to a better model rather than boosting them via GBDT. Besides, the adopted feature importance approach decreases the overall accuracy by only up to 5% in most of the estimated models. Moreover, the worst class recall value of the RF algorithm without prior oversampling is only 34.4% compared to the corresponding value of 90.3% in the up-sampled model which validates the proposed multi-step preprocessing scheme. This study also identifies the temporal and spatial (roadway) attributes, as well as crash characteristics, and Emergency Medical Service (EMS) as the most critical factors in truck crash severity.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,,18,3,e0281901,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mohammadpour, Seyed Iman; Khedmati, Majid; Zada, Mohammad Javad Hassan","Mohammadpour, Seyed Iman (Civil Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.); Khedmati, Majid (Department of Industrial Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.); Zada, Mohammad Javad Hassan (Department of Mobility Systems Engineering, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.)",,"Mohammadpour, Seyed Iman (Sharif University of Technology); Khedmati, Majid (Sharif University of Technology); Zada, Mohammad Javad Hassan (Technical University of Munich)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281901&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401240,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4611 Machine Learning",3 Good Health and Well Being

We conducted a study to qualitatively explore physician-reported CPR/DNAR decision-making approaches and CPR/DNAR conversations with patients hospitalized in the internal medicine wards of the four main hospitals in Ticino, Southern Switzerland. We conducted four focus groups with 19 resident and staff physicians employed in the internal medicine unit of the four public hospitals in Ticino. Questions aimed to elicit participants' specific experiences in deciding on and discussing CPR/DNAR with patients and their families, the stakeholders (ideally) involved in the discussion, and their responsibilities. We found that participants experienced two main tensions. On the one side, CPR/DNAR decisions were dominated by the belief that patient involvement is often pointless, even though participants favored a shared decision-making approach. On the other, despite aiming at a non-manipulative conversation, participants were aware that most CPR/DNAR conversations are characterized by a nudging communicative approach where the physician gently pushes patients towards his/her recommendation. Participants identified structural cause to the previous two tensions that go beyond the patient-physician relationship. CPR/DNAR decisions are examples of best interests assessments at the end of life. Such assessments represent value judgments that cannot be validly ascertained without patient input. CPR/DNAR conversations should be regarded as complex interventions that need to be thoroughly and regularly taught, in a manner similar to technical interventions.",We thank all the resident and staff physicians who participated in the study.

It was also a live experiment in the formation and alteration of disease-related attitudes. Not only are these attitudes relevant to an individual's self-protective behavior, but they also seem to be associated with social and political attitudes more broadly. One of these attitudes is Social Darwinism, which holds that a pandemic benefits society by enabling nature ""to weed out the weak"". In two countries (N = 300, N = 533), we introduce and provide evidence for the reliability, validity, and usefulness of the Disease-Related Social Darwinism (DRSD) Short Scale measuring this concept. Results indicate that DRSD is meaningful related to other central political attitudes like Social Dominance Orientation, Authoritarianism and neoliberalism. Importantly, the scale significantly predicted people's protective behavior during the Pandemic over and above general social Darwinism.

A scoping review of reviews and evidence map.,"OBJECTIVES: Mental well-being is critical to quality of life. Workplace mental well-being is crucial to ensure employee health, satisfaction, and performance. Mental ill-health is a global challenge, costing workplaces $17 billion per year. Workplaces have realized the need for investment in interventions to promote mental health and well-being in their workforce. However, given their limited resources, workplace personnel responsible for program implementation need evidence-based guidance on which interventions influence which outcomes.
METHODS: This study employed a scoping review methodology in order to produce an evidence map and includes reviews of workplace mental well-being interventions. The search strategy focused on peer-reviewed articles with the primary aim of investigating workplace mental health interventions. Reviews were assessed for quality using AMSTAR 2. The evidence map includes interventions (rows) and outcomes (columns), with the relative size of the reviews underpinning each intersection represented by circles and the direction of evidence represented by color.
RESULTS: Eighty reviews were deemed eligible from 4795 citations. The resulting evidence map includes 17 intervention types designed to influence 12 outcomes. Interventions with the highest quality evidence were mindfulness, education and information provision, and individual psychological therapies. The most common outcomes were burnout / stress reduction and mental well-being. Interventions tended to focus on individual level factors rather than organizational or system-level factors.
CONCLUSION: The evidence-base for workplace mental health interventions is broad and extensive. There is an apparent knowledge-to-practice gap, presenting challenges to implementing workplace mental health programs (ie, what interventions have the highest quality evidence). This study aims to fill the gap by providing an interactive evidence-map. Future research should look to fill the gaps within the map including the lack of organization and system level factors and especially economic evaluations.",,,"Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment & Health",,,2023-03-22,2023,2023-03-22,2023-03-22,,,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Waddell, Alex; Kunstler, Breanne; Lennox, Alyse; Pattuwage, Loyal; Grundy, Emily A C; Tsering, Diki; Olivier, Patrick; Bragge, Peter","Waddell, Alex (Department of Human-Centred Computing, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Clayton Campus, Melbourne, VIC, 3800, Australia. alex.waddell@monash.edu.); Kunstler, Breanne (); Lennox, Alyse (); Pattuwage, Loyal (); Grundy, Emily A C (); Tsering, Diki (); Olivier, Patrick (); Bragge, Peter ()",,"Waddell, Alex (Monash University); Kunstler, Breanne (); Lennox, Alyse (); Pattuwage, Loyal (); Grundy, Emily A C (); Tsering, Diki (); Olivier, Patrick (); Bragge, Peter ()",0,0,,,https://www.sjweh.fi/download.php?abstract_id=4087&file_nro=1,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156398187,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

A quantitative retrospective study was conducted at a public hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa by reviewing patient files of children diagnosed with ASD and meeting the inclusion criteria for the study. A descriptive analysis of data was done to identify treatment trends and patient therapeutic outcomes. A total of 181 children met the inclusion criteria of the study. Risperidone was the most frequently prescribed drug (88%) for the management of comorbidities and/or core symptoms of ASD. Drugs prescribed to manage ASD comorbidities included methylphenidate, melatonin, sodium valproate, risperidone, oxybutynin, carbamazepine, and others. Except for risperidone, there were no additional drugs that targeted the core symptoms of ASD. Non-pharmacological therapies were often used collaboratively with medication to manage ASD symptoms. In 41% of patients, there were improvements in their symptoms.","Special thanks to all individuals who kindly assisted in the study, including the KZN Department of Health and the public hospital that granted permission to conduct the study.",Open access funding provided by University of KwaZulu-Natal.

OD is advocated to help increase academic influences and promote scientific discovery and development, but such a proposition has not been elaborated on well. This study explores the nuanced effects of the OD policies on the citation pattern of articles by using the case of Chinese economics journals. China Industrial Economics (CIE) is the first and only Chinese social science journal so far to adopt a compulsory OD policy, requiring all published articles to share original data and processing codes. We use the article-level data and difference-in-differences (DID) approach to compare the citation performance of articles published in CIE and 36 comparable journals. Firstly, we find that the OD policy quickly increased the number of citations, and each article on average received 0.25, 1.19, 0.86, and 0.44 more citations in the first four years after publication respectively. Furthermore, we also found that the citation benefit of the OD policy rapidly decreased over time, and even became negative in the fifth year after publication. In conclusion, this changing citation pattern suggests that an OD policy can be double edged sword, which can quickly increase citation performance but simultaneously accelerate the aging of articles.","We thank altmetric.com for sharing the data used in this study.

This study explored whether mother and father personality traits relate to offspring behavior problems in mid-late adolescence METHOD: In total, 3089 Australian adolescents (1576 boys, 1513 girls; Mage  = 16.46 ± 0.50 years) and their parents completed questionnaires assessing personality, conduct problems, emotional and social functioning, antisocial and criminal behavior, cigarette smoking and drug use, at a single time-point.
RESULTS: After controlling for sociodemographic factors, results showed that problem behaviors in adolescence were most consistently related to mothers' scores on neuroticism and conscientiousness, and fathers' scores on neuroticism. Father personality traits were most important for antisocial and criminal behavior, whereas mother personality traits were most important for social and emotional functioning. Moderation analysis showed that associations between fathers' personality traits and some adolescent outcomes (cigarette smoking and drug use) were stronger for adolescent boys than for adolescent girls. Mediation models further demonstrated that adolescent personality traits mediated associations between parent personality and adolescent outcomes in almost all cases. Indirect effects expressed as a percentage showed that between 1.4% and 33.3% of the variance in the association between parent personality and adolescent outcomes was shared with the corresponding adolescent personality trait.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings of this study provide evidence that traits inherited (directly or indirectly) from parents might have an important role in shaping problem behavior in adolescence.",,,Journal of Adolescence,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,2023-03-21,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Robson, Davina A.; Allen, Mark S.; Laborde, Sylvain","Robson, Davina A.

Executive function decline due to aging increases the risk of disability and falls in older adults, which has become an urgent public health issue. Fast and convenient neuropsychological tools are thus needed to identify high-risk groups as early as possible to conduct a timely intervention. Card sorting tasks, such as Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) and its variants, are popular tools for measuring executive function. This study investigated the reliability of an open-source, self-administered, online, short-version card sorting task with a sample of young (n = 107, 65 females, age: M = 30.1 years, SD = 5.5 years) and elderly Chinese (n = 113, 53 females, age: M = 64.0 years, SD = 6.7 years). We developed an automated scoring and visualization procedure following the recent recommendations on scoring perseverative responses to make the results comparable to the standardized WCST. Reliability estimates of commonly used measures were calculated using the split-half method. All task indices' reliabilities were reasonably good in both old and young groups except for ""failure-to-maintain-set.""

We use two continuous time-series datasets and one panel dataset, assessing changes over time within city and comparing across cities, and disaggregate major findings by age. For clinical results, ART use showed by far the smallest reductions, and testing the largest. Disruptions occurred concurrently between cities, despite the major wave of COVID-19, and government mandates, occurring later in Atlanta. Test positivity increased in NYC only. In both cities, younger MSM saw the greatest reductions in testing and PrEP use, but the smallest in sexual behavior. Reduced clinical service usage would be unconcerning if stemming solely from reductions in exposure; however, the patterns for young MSM suggest that the COVID-19 epidemic likely generated new conditions for increased HIV transmission, especially in this cohort.","The authors thank the members of the Coalition for Applied Modeling for Prevention (CAMP), especially Monica Trigg, Abby Tighe, Tamika Hoyte, Taiwo Abimbola, Michelle van Handel, Erika Martin, and Eli Rosenberg.

The Autobiographical Interview (AI; Levine et al.

The AI has been widely adopted, yet has not undergone a comprehensive psychometric validation. We investigated the reliability, validity, association to individual differences measures, and factor structure in healthy younger and older adults (N = 352). Evidence for the AI’s reliability was strong: the subjective scoring protocol showed high inter-rater reliability and previously identified age effects were replicated. Internal consistency across timepoints was robust, suggesting stability in recollection. Central to our validation, internal AI scores were positively correlated with standard, performance-based measures of episodic memory, demonstrating convergent validity. The two-factor structure for the AI was not well supported by confirmatory factor analysis. Adjusting internal and external detail scores for the number of words spoken (detail density) improved trait estimation of AM performance.

MOG-specific antibodies (Abs) from patients are pathogenic, but the precise effector mechanisms are currently still unknown and no therapy is approved for MOGAD. Here, we determined the contributions of complement and Fc-receptor (FcR)-mediated effects in the pathogenicity of MOG-Abs. Starting from a recombinant anti-MOG (mAb) with human IgG1 Fc, we established MOG-specific mutant mAbs with differential FcR and C1q binding. We then applied selected mutants of this MOG-mAb in two animal models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. First, we found MOG-mAb-induced demyelination was mediated by both complement and FcRs about equally. Second, we found that MOG-Abs enhanced activation of cognate MOG-specific T cells in the central nervous system (CNS), which was dependent on FcR-, but not C1q-binding. The identification of complement-dependent and -independent pathomechanisms of MOG-Abs has implications for therapeutic strategies in MOGAD.","We thank Prof. Dr. Hartmut Wekerle and Prof. Dr. Reinhard Hohlfeld, Dr. Anneli Peters, and Dr. Eduardo Beltrán for comments on the manuscript.

To advance current knowledge, we synthesize research on interventions aiming to promote climate change mitigation behaviors in field settings. In a preregistered second-order meta-analysis, we assess the overall effect of 10 meta-analyses, incorporating a total of 430 primary studies. In addition, we assess subgroup analyses for six types of interventions, five behaviors, and three publication bias adjustments. Results showed that climate change mitigation interventions were generally effective (dunadjusted = 0.31, 95% CI [0.30, 0.32]). A follow-up analysis using only unique primary studies, adjusted for publication bias, provides a more conservative overall estimate (d = 0.18, 95% CI [0.13, 0.24]). This translates into a mean treatment effect of 7 percentage points. Furthermore, in a subsample of adequately powered large-scale interventions (n > 9,000, k = 32), the effect was adjusted downward to approximately 2 percentage points. This discrepancy might be because large-scale interventions often target nonvoluntary participants by less direct techniques (e.g., ""home energy reports"") while small-scale interventions often target voluntary participants by more direct techniques (e.g., face-to-face interactions). Subgroup analyses showed that interventions based on social comparisons or financial incentives were the most effective, while education or feedback was the least effective. These results provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art summary of climate change mitigation interventions, guiding both future research and practice.","We would like to acknowledge authors of first-order meta-analysis and primary studies for providing information (e.g., Steffen Kallbekken, Håkon Sælen, and Alexander Maki), Wesley P.

Objectives: This is a systematic review of the research on therapist methods to facilitate patient ER, including affect-focused, experiential methods that aim to enhance immediate patient emotion regulation, and structured psychoeducation, skills training in ER.
METHOD: A total of 10 studies of immediate and intermediate outcomes of emotion regulation methods were examined. A total of 38 studies were included in the meta-analysis of distal treatment effects on emotion regulation.
RESULTS: In eight studies with 84 clients and 33 therapists, we found evidence of positive intermediate outcomes for affect-focused therapist methods and interpretations. A meta-analysis of 26 studies showed that the average effect size of ER methods from pre- to post-treatment was large (g = 0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: Both affect-focused and structured skill training are associated with distal improvements in emotion regulation. When working with ER in psychotherapy, therapists must consider how patients' cultural backgrounds inform display rules, as well as what might be considered adaptive or maladaptive.

In particular, previous evidence suggests the importance of parental scaffolding, or provision of cognitive structure to shape child behaviour. A role for scaffolding is consistent with the proposal that, in adult cognition, a critical aspect of g is decomposition of complex problems into a structure of simpler parts. Building on previous work, we recruited 162 parents attending Children’s Centres with a child aged 2–4 years, and examined parental scaffolding during a book-sharing activity. Scaffolding was measured as the first principal component of a variety of parental behaviours, including sensitivity, focusing attention, extending comprehension, and promoting child participation. Child g was measured as the first principal component of a broad cognitive battery, including language, attention, working memory, and executive function. Importantly, we assessed contributions of the parent’s own intelligence, education, and family income. Though these variables were all associated with both child g and parental scaffolding, scaffolding remained predictive of child g even once the influence of these variables was removed. In contrast to the correlation with cognitive proficiency, scaffolding did not predict child pro-social behaviour. We suggest that parental scaffolding supports the child’s development of a broad skill of attentional structuring, promoting the across-the-board cognitive proficiency that is reflected in g.","This work was supported by Grant EDO/42798 from the Nuffield Foundation, and from Medical Research Council (United Kingdom), program MC_UU_00005/6.

The abundance of cell surface PD-L1 is a key determinant of the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy targeting PD-L1. However, the regulation of cell surface PD-L1 is still poorly understood. Here, we show that lysosomal degradation of PD-L1 is regulated by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) during the intracellular trafficking pathway. O-GlcNAc modifies the hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS), a key component of the endosomal sorting machinery, and subsequently inhibits its interaction with intracellular PD-L1, leading to impaired lysosomal degradation of PD-L1. O-GlcNAc inhibition activates T cell-mediated antitumor immunity in vitro and in immune-competent mice in a manner dependent on HGS glycosylation. Combination of O-GlcNAc inhibition with PD-L1 antibody synergistically promotes antitumor immune response. We also designed a competitive peptide inhibitor of HGS glycosylation that decreases PD-L1 expression and enhances T cell-mediated immunity against tumor cells. Collectively, our study reveals a link between O-GlcNAc and tumor immune evasion, and suggests strategies for improving PD-L1-mediated immune checkpoint blockade therapy.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 31971212 and 32271331 to W.Y., 32201045 to Q.Z., 82271763 to L.W., 32270746 and 82203247 to L.X.), the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LZ21C050001 to W.Y., LZ23C060002 to L.X., and LQ22H160058 to B.L.), the Major Projects of Medicine and Health in Zhejiang Province (WKJ-ZJ-2306), the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities (K20220228), and the Mizutani Foundation for Glycoscience (210036 to W.Y.).",,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,2023-03-28,120,13,e2216796120,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Zhu, Qiang; Wang, Hongxing; Chai, Siyuan; Xu, Liang; Lin, Bingyi; Yi, Wen; Wu, Liming","Zhu, Qiang (Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pancreatic Disease, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China; Department of Biochemistry, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Biosystems Homeostasis & Protection, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China); Wang, Hongxing (Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pancreatic Disease, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China); Chai, Siyuan (Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pancreatic Disease, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China); Xu, Liang (Department of Biochemistry, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Biosystems Homeostasis & Protection, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China; Cancer Center, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China); Lin, Bingyi (Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pancreatic Disease, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China); Yi, Wen (Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pancreatic Disease, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China; Department of Biochemistry, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Biosystems Homeostasis & Protection, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China; Cancer Center, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China); Wu, Liming (Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pancreatic Disease, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China)","Yi, Wen (Zhejiang University; First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University); Wu, Liming (Zhejiang University; First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University)","Zhu, Qiang (Zhejiang University; First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University); Wang, Hongxing (Zhejiang University; First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University); Chai, Siyuan (Zhejiang University; First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University); Xu, Liang (Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University); Lin, Bingyi (Zhejiang University; First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University); Yi, Wen (Zhejiang University; First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University); Wu, Liming (Zhejiang University; First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2216796120,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156376742,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3204 Immunology; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,
500,pub.1156408724,10.1002/cbm.2285,36945075,,Measuring the costs of crime using the willingness‐to‐pay method,"BACKGROUND: Criminal justice policy decisions are increasingly being influenced by the ratio of the monetary benefits to the monetary costs. While policies based on evidence and analysed via cost-benefit studies are a welcome development, cost-benefit calculations are only as robust as the data upon which they are based. For England and Wales up to the present, cost-of-crime estimates used in cost-benefit analyses have been calculated by the Home Office using a multi-method approach. However, the intangible costs of crime have not been estimated adequately in England and Wales.
AIM: The main aim was to quantify the intangible costs of crime using the willingness-to-pay (WTP) method. Also, stated preferences for different crime reduction methods were investigated.
METHOD: This study utilises samples from the City of Cambridge (n = 534) and from Criminal Justice Practitioners (n = 124), to assess their WTP to prevent a range of crimes from happening in their neighbourhood, and their preferred crime reduction techniques. A Contingent Valuation Survey (CVS) was used.
RESULTS: Overall, both samples gave a higher WTP for low volume, high harm crimes than for high volume, low harm crimes. Both samples supported funding youth programmes in preference to other forms of crime reduction initiatives.
CONCLUSION: It is proposed that a CVS should be included in the next Crime Survey for England and Wales, in order to collect relevant WTP data on crime at the national level.",,,Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,2023-03-21,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Gowar, Bea L.

Current models suggest that, not only physical similarity, but also abstract, conceptual features shared between self and the interacting partner play a key role in the emergence of joint action effects. Across two experiments, we investigated the influence of the perceived humanness of a robotic agent on the extent to which we integrate the action of that agent into our own action/task representation, as indexed by the Joint Simon Effect (JSE). The presence (vs. absence) of a prior verbal interaction was used to manipulate robot's perceived humanness. In Experiment 1, using a within-participant design, we had participants perform the joint Go/No-go Simon task with two different robots. Before performing the joint task, one robot engaged in a verbal interaction with the participant and the other robot did not. In Experiment 2, we employed a between-participants design to contrast these two robot conditions as well as a human partner condition. In both experiments, a significant Simon effect emerged during joint action and its amplitude was not modulated by the humanness of the interacting partner. Experiment 2 further showed that the JSE obtained in robot conditions did not differ from that measured in the human partner condition. These findings contradict current theories of joint action mechanisms according to which perceived self-other similarity is a crucial determinant of self-other integration in shared task settings.",,,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,2023-03-21,,,17470218231158481,All OA; Green,Article,"Bouquet, Cédric A; Belletier, Clément; Monceau, Sophie; Chausse, Pierre; Croizet, Jean-Claude; Huguet, Pascal; Ferrand, Ludovic","Bouquet, Cédric A (CNRS, LAPSCO, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.; CNRS, CeRCA, Université de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.); Belletier, Clément (CNRS, LAPSCO, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.); Monceau, Sophie (CNRS, LAPSCO, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.); Chausse, Pierre (CNRS, LAPSCO, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.); Croizet, Jean-Claude (CNRS, LAPSCO, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.); Huguet, Pascal (CNRS, LAPSCO, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.); Ferrand, Ludovic (CNRS, LAPSCO, Université Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.)",,"Bouquet, Cédric A (Laboratoire de Psychologie Sociale et Cognitive; Research Centre on Cognition and Learning); Belletier, Clément (Laboratoire de Psychologie Sociale et Cognitive); Monceau, Sophie (Laboratoire de Psychologie Sociale et Cognitive); Chausse, Pierre (Laboratoire de Psychologie Sociale et Cognitive); Croizet, Jean-Claude (Laboratoire de Psychologie Sociale et Cognitive); Huguet, Pascal (Laboratoire de Psychologie Sociale et Cognitive); Ferrand, Ludovic (Laboratoire de Psychologie Sociale et Cognitive)",0,0,,,https://hal.science/hal-03959180/file/Bouquet-et-al-2023-QJEP-HAL.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155523478,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,

The present research tested the idea that parents develop sex role consistent expectations of their babies’ attributes based on fetal sex (by ultrasound diagnostic), as well as gendered perceptions of their recently newborn babies. A total of 304 dyads of predominantly White expecting parents from Germany were followed over the course of pregnancy until after the birth and completed a sex role inventory on their babies’ expected (before birth) as well as perceived traits (after birth). Specifically, they rated to what extent they expected their babies to have normatively feminine traits (e.g., soft-spoken and warm) and normatively masculine traits (e.g., independent and assertive) twice before birth (first half of pregnancy, six weeks before due date) and to what extent they perceived their baby to have these traits eight weeks after birth. The results suggested that fathers held gendered expectations and perceptions, whereas mothers did not. These results suggest that male and female babies are likely to encounter sex role stereotypes about their alleged attributes as soon as their birth.",,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

However, after cessation of the force, how structures are altered in response to the dynamics of the chromatin and molecules in the nucleoplasm remains elusive. Here, using single-molecule imaging approaches, we show that exogenous local forces via integrins applied for 2 to 10 min decondensed the chromatin and increased chromatin and nucleoplasm protein mobility inside the nucleus, leading to elevated diffusivity of single protein molecules in the nucleoplasm, tens of minutes after the cessation of force. Diffusion experiments with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy in live single cells show that the mechanomemory in chromatin and nucleoplasm protein diffusivity was regulated by nuclear pore complexes. Protein molecular dynamics simulation recapitulated the experimental findings in live cells and showed that nucleoplasm protein diffusivity was regulated by the number of nuclear pore complexes. The mechanomemory in elevated protein diffusivity of the nucleoplasm after force cessation represents a physical process that reverses protein-protein condensation in phase separation via unjamming of the chromatin.

METHODS: The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) data were utilized to quantify PJI incidence after hip or knee replacement up to 5 years after implant and a variety of risk factors related to patient characteristics, medical and treatment history along with characteristics of the original surgery were analyzed through Cox proportional hazard.
RESULTS: 221,826 patients (individual joints 283,789) met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study; during the study follow-up period (5 years), 707 and 695 PJIs were diagnosed in hip and knee, respectively. Patients undergoing joint replacement surgery during an unscheduled hospitalization had greater risk of PJI than patients whose surgery was elective; similarly, the risk of developing PJI after a secondary hip or knee replacement was about 4 times greater than after primary arthroplasty when adjusted for all other variables considered. A previous diagnosis of PJI, even in a different joint, increased the risk of a further PJI. Distribution of average LoS per each hospitalization caused by PJI exhibited a right skewed profile with median duration [IQR] duration of 16 days [8-32] and 13 days [7.25-32] for hip and knee, respectively. PJIs causative micro-organisms were dependent on the time between initial surgery and infection offset; early PJI were more likely to be multispecies than later (years after surgery); the identification of Gram- pathogens decreased with increasing post-surgery follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a contemporary assessment of the budgetary and capacity (number and duration of hospitalizations along with the number of Accident and Emergency (A&E) visits) posed by PJIs in UK for the national healthcare system (NHS). The results to provide risk management and planning tools to health providers and policy makers in order to fully assess technologies aimed at controlling and preventing PJI.

Literature indicates room for enhancing openness to discuss ethical sensitive issues within and between teams, and improving decision-making for benefit of the patient at end-of-life.
METHODS: Stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design, run across 10 different departments of the Ghent University Hospital between January 2022 and January 2023. Dutch speaking adult patients and one of their relatives will be included for data collection. All 10 departments were randomly assigned to start a 4-month coaching period. Junior and senior doctors will be coached through observation and debrief by a first coach of the interdisciplinary meetings and individual coaching by the second coach to enhance self-reflection and empowering leadership and managing group dynamics with regard to ethical decision-making. Nurses, junior doctors and senior doctors anonymously report perceptions of excessive treatment via the electronic patient file. Once a patient is identified by two or more different clinicians, an email is sent to the second coach and the doctor in charge of the patient. All nurses, junior and senior doctors will be invited to fill out the ethical decision making climate questionnaire at the start and end of the 12-months study period. Primary endpoints are (1) incidence of written do-not-intubate and resuscitate orders in patients potentially receiving excessive treatment and (2) quality of ethical decision-making climate. Secondary endpoints are patient and family well-being and reports on quality of care and communication; and clinician well-being. Tertiairy endpoints are quantitative and qualitative data of doctor leadership quality.
DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized control trial exploring the effects of coaching doctors in self-reflection and empowering leadership, and in the management of team dynamics, with regard to ethical decision-making about patients potentially receiving excessive treatment.","We wish to thank Anouska De Smeytere and Bram Gadeyne for respectively logistic and ICT support and all persons who contributed to the study as part of the CODE study group: Céline Jacobs and Aglaja De Pauw from the Medical Oncology Department, Alfred Meurs and Dimitri Hemelsoet from the Neurology Department, Jiska Maloteaux from the Internal Medicine Department, Anja Velghe and Nele Van Den Noorgate from the Geriatrics Department, Pieter Depuydt and Patrick Druwé from the Intensive Care Medicine Department, Hans Van Vlierberghe, Anja Geerts, Eduard Callebaut and Karen Geboes from the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Department, Eric Derom and Dieter Stevens from the Pneumology Department, Michel De Pauw, Lineke Hens and Fiona Tromp from the Cardiology Department, Ine Moors and Fritz Offner from the Hematology Department and Francis Verbeke and Wim Van Biesen from the Nephrology Department, all at the Ghent University Hospital, Belgium.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,,18,3,e0281447,All OA; Gold,Article,"Benoit, Dominique D.; Vanheule, Stijn; Manesse, Frank; Anseel, Frederik; De Soete, Geert; Goethals, Katrijn; Lievrouw, An; Vansteelandt, Stijn; De Haan, Erik; Piers, Ruth; ","Benoit, Dominique D.

500,pub.1156376740,10.1073/pnas.2218819120,36943875,,Unraveling the intricate cargo-BBSome coupling mechanism at the ciliary tip,"Certain ciliary transmembrane and membrane-tethered signaling proteins migrate from the ciliary tip to base via retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT), essential for maintaining their ciliary dynamics to enable cells to sense and transduce extracellular stimuli inside the cell. During this process, the BBSome functions as an adaptor between retrograde IFT trains and these signaling protein cargoes. The Arf-like 13 (ARL13) small GTPase resembles ARL6/BBS3 in facilitating these signaling cargoes to couple with the BBSome at the ciliary tip prior to loading onto retrograde IFT trains for transporting towards the ciliary base, while the molecular basis for how this intricate coupling event happens remains elusive. Here, we report that Chlamydomonas ARL13 only in a GTP-bound form (ARL13GTP) anchors to the membrane for diffusing into cilia. Upon entering cilia, ARL13 undergoes GTPase cycle for shuttling between the ciliary membrane (ARL13GTP) and matrix (ARL13GDP). To achieve this goal, the ciliary membrane-anchored BBS3GTP binds the ciliary matrix-residing ARL13GDP to activate the latter as an ARL13 guanine nucleotide exchange factor. At the ciliary tip, ARL13GTP recruits the ciliary matrix-residing and post-remodeled BBSome as an ARL13 effector to anchor to the ciliary membrane. This makes the BBSome spatiotemporally become available for the ciliary membrane-tethered phospholipase D (PLD) to couple with. Afterward, ARL13GTP hydrolyzes GTP for releasing the PLD-laden BBSome to load onto retrograde IFT trains. According to this model, hedgehog signaling defects associated with ARL13b and BBS3 mutations in humans could be satisfactorily explained, providing us a mechanistic understanding behind BBSome-cargo coupling required for proper ciliary signaling.","Research reported in this publication was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant 32070698 to Z.-C.F. and National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant 32200558 and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Grant 2021M702457 to Y.-X.L.

The whale shark, which dives into the deep sea of nearly 2,000 meters besides near-surface filter feeding, was previously shown to possess the 'blue-shifted' rhodopsin (RHO), which is a signature of deep-sea adaptation. In this study, our spectroscopy of recombinant whale shark RHO mutants revealed that this blue shift is caused dominantly by an unprecedented spectral tuning site 94. In humans, the mutation at the site causes congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) by reducing the thermal stability of RHO. Similarly, the RHO of deep-diving whale shark has reduced thermal stability, which was experimentally shown to be achieved by site 178 and 94. RHOs having the natural substitution at site 94 are also found in some Antarctic fishes, suggesting that the blue shift by the substitution at the CSNB site associated with the reduction in thermal stability might be allowed in cold-water deep-sea habitats.","We thank Rui Matsumoto, Ryo Nozu, and Kiyomi Murakumo at Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium for their assistance in sampling.

Here, we uncover a unique balance in two critical innate pathways governing the severity of disease. In the low-pathology setting, parasite egg-stimulated dendritic cells (DCs) induce robust interferon (IFN)β production, which is dependent on the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) cytosolic DNA sensing pathway and results in a Th2 response with suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production and Th17 cell activation. IFNβ induces signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1, which suppresses CD209a, a C-type lectin receptor associated with severe disease. In contrast, in the high-pathology setting, enhanced DC expression of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (Gsdmd) results in reduced expression of cGAS/STING, impaired IFNβ, and enhanced pyroptosis. Our findings demonstrate that cGAS/STING signaling represents a unique mechanism inducing protective type I IFN, which is counteracted by Gsdmd.","We would like to thank Schistosomiasis Resource Center (NIH) for providing S. mansoni genomic DNA and schistosome-infected snails.

They perform key cellular functions such as immunomodulation and cell-cell recognition. Yet, how their composition and configuration affect their functions remains enigmatic. Here, we constructed isogenic capsule-switch mutants harboring 84 types of capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) in Streptococcus pneumoniae. This collection enables us to systematically measure the affinity of structurally related CPSs to primary human nasal and bronchial epithelial cells. Contrary to the paradigm, the surface charge does not appreciably affect epithelial cell binding. Factors that affect adhesion to respiratory cells include the number of rhamnose residues and the presence of human-like glycomotifs in CPS. Besides, pneumococcal colonization stimulated the production of interleukin 6 (IL-6), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and monocyte chemoattractantprotein-1 (MCP-1) in nasal epithelial cells, which also appears to be dependent on the serotype.

While some alternative educational settings (i.e., Montessori) were shown to nurture creative skills, it is unknown how they impact underlying brain mechanisms across the school years. This study assessed creative thinking and resting-state functional connectivity via fMRI in 75 children (4-18 y.o.) enrolled either in Montessori or traditional schools. We found that pedagogy significantly influenced creative performance and underlying brain networks. Replicating past work, Montessori-schooled children showed higher scores on creative thinking tests. Using static functional connectivity analysis, we found that Montessori-schooled children showed decreased within-network functional connectivity of the salience network. Moreover, using dynamic functional connectivity, we found that traditionally-schooled children spent more time in a brain state characterized by high intra-default mode network connectivity. These findings suggest that pedagogy may influence brain networks relevant to creative thinking-particularly the default and salience networks. Further research is needed, like a longitudinal study, to verify these results given the implications for educational practitioners. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Most executive jobs are prospected to be obsolete within several decades, so creative skills are seen as essential for the near future. School experience has been shown to play a role in creativity development, however, the underlying brain mechanisms remained under-investigated yet. Seventy-five 4-18 years-old children, from Montessori or traditional schools, performed a creativity task at the behavioral level, and a 6-min resting-state MR scan. We uniquely report preliminary evidence for the impact of pedagogy on functional brain networks.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Solange Denervaud is supported by a grant from the Société Académique Vaudoise, the Prepared Adult Initiative, and Logival.

These problems can have long lasting, detrimental effects on the child, their parents and society. Most children with a mental health problem do not receive professional help. Those that do get help can face long wait times. While waiting, parents want to learn how they can help their child. To address this need, we co-designed a new website to help parents find ways of helping their child's mental health problem while waiting to get specialist help.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the acceptability and feasibility of a new co-designed website, FindWays, through a pilot randomised controlled trial. The protocol is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN64605513).
METHODS: This study will recruit up to 60 parents of children aged two-twelve years old referred to a paediatrician for behavioural and/or emotional problems. Participants will be randomly allocated by computer generated number sequence to either the intervention or control group. Intervention group participants will receive access to the FindWays website to help them manage their child's mental health problem while they wait to see the paediatrician. Acceptability and feasibility will be assessed over the 4-month intervention through mixed methods including: recruitment, adherence, retention, net promoter score (quantitative measures) and semi-structured interviews to gain an in-depth understanding of parents' experience and potential adverse effects (qualitative measure). Secondary outcomes measured by parent survey at 4-months post randomisation include child mental health, parent mental health, impact of the child's mental health problem on their functioning and family, and health service use and associated costs.
RESULTS: Recruitment commenced June 2022 with publication expected in October 2023.
CONCLUSION: This study will provide novel data on the acceptability and feasibility of a new website co-designed with parents to help them find ways of managing their child's behaviour and emotions.","The authors would like to acknowledge the co-design participants for their valuable input.

A variety of human cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and mast cell leukemia, are driven by somatic gain-of-function KIT mutations. Here, we report cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural analyses of full-length wild-type and two oncogenic KIT mutants, which show that the overall symmetric arrangement of the extracellular domain of ligand-occupied KIT dimers contains asymmetric D5 homotypic contacts juxtaposing the plasma membrane. Mutational analysis of KIT reveals in D5 region an ""Achilles heel"" for therapeutic intervention. A ligand-sensitized oncogenic KIT mutant exhibits a more comprehensive and stable D5 asymmetric conformation. A constitutively active ligand-independent oncogenic KIT mutant adopts a V-shaped conformation solely held by D5-mediated contacts. Binding of SCF to this mutant fully restores the conformation of wild-type KIT dimers, including the formation of salt bridges responsible for D4 homotypic contacts and other hallmarks of SCF-induced KIT dimerization. These experiments reveal an unexpected structural plasticity of oncogenic KIT mutants and a therapeutic target in D5.","We thank the members of the Schlessinger laboratory for valuable discussions, and Seong An and Nathan Kucera for proof-reading of the manuscript.

However, not much is known about how the cone-shaped capsid interacts with the nucleoporins (NUPs) in the nuclear pore for crossing the nuclear pore complex. Here, we elucidate how NUP153 binds HIV-1 capsid by engaging the assembled capsid protein (CA) lattice. A bipartite motif containing both canonical and noncanonical interaction modules was identified at the C-terminal tail region of NUP153. The canonical cargo-targeting phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motif engaged the CA hexamer. By contrast, a previously unidentified triple-arginine (RRR) motif in NUP153 targeted HIV-1 capsid at the CA tri-hexamer interface in the capsid. HIV-1 infection studies indicated that both FG- and RRR-motifs were important for the nuclear import of HIV-1 cores. Moreover, the presence of NUP153 stabilized tubular CA assemblies in vitro. Our results provide molecular-level mechanistic evidence that NUP153 contributes to the entry of the intact capsid into the nucleus.","We thank the Xiong Lab for discussions.

Here, we study 1950 to 2021 trends in the frequency of occurrence of atmospheric circulation patterns over the North Atlantic. Roughly 7% of atmospheric circulation patterns display significant occurrence trends, yet they have major impacts on surface climate. Increasingly frequent patterns drive heatwaves across Europe and enhanced wintertime storminess in the northern part of the continent. Over 91% of recent heatwave-related deaths and 33% of high-impact windstorms in Europe were concurrent with increasingly frequent atmospheric circulation patterns. While the trends identified are statistically significant, they are not necessarily anthropogenic. Atmospheric patterns which are becoming rarer correspond instead to wet, cool summer conditions over northern Europe and wet winter conditions over continental Europe. The combined effect of these circulation changes is that of a strong, dynamically driven year-round warming over most of the continent and large regional and seasonal changes in precipitation and surface wind.","D.F., M.V., and P.Y. received funding under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. 101003469, XAIDA).

500,pub.1156376741,10.1073/pnas.2217084120,36943876,,NHA1 is a cation/proton antiporter essential for the water-conserving functions of the rectal complex in Tribolium castaneum,"More than half of all extant metazoan species on earth are insects. The evolutionary success of insects is linked with their ability to osmoregulate, suggesting that they have evolved unique physiological mechanisms to maintain water balance. In beetles (Coleoptera)-the largest group of insects-a specialized rectal (""cryptonephridial"") complex has evolved that recovers water from the rectum destined for excretion and recycles it back to the body. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the remarkable water-conserving functions of this system are unknown. Here, we introduce a transcriptomic resource, BeetleAtlas.org, for the exceptionally desiccation-tolerant red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, and demonstrate its utility by identifying a cation/H+ antiporter (NHA1) that is enriched and functionally significant in the Tribolium rectal complex. NHA1 localizes exclusively to a specialized cell type, the leptophragmata, in the distal region of the Malpighian tubules associated with the rectal complex. Computational modeling and electrophysiological characterization in Xenopus oocytes show that NHA1 acts as an electroneutral K+/H+ antiporter. Furthermore, genetic silencing of Nha1 dramatically increases excretory water loss and reduces organismal survival during desiccation stress, implying that NHA1 activity is essential for maintaining systemic water balance. Finally, we show that Tiptop, a conserved transcription factor, regulates NHA1 expression in leptophragmata and controls leptophragmata maturation, illuminating the developmental mechanism that establishes the functions of this cell. Together, our work provides insights into the molecular architecture underpinning the function of one of the most powerful water-conserving mechanisms in nature, the beetle rectal complex.","We are grateful to Dr. Gregor Bucher for providing Tribolium embryo samples.

This pre-registered study examined psychometric features of a new EPELI adult online version, modified from the original child version and further developed for self-administered web-based testing at home. A sample of 255 healthy adults completed EPELI where their task was to perform household chores instructed by a virtual character. The participants also filled out PM-related questionnaires and a diary and performed two conventional PM tasks and an intelligence test. We expected that the more ""life-like"" EPELI task would show stronger associations with conventional PM questionnaires and diary-based everyday PM reports than traditional PM tasks would do. This hypothesis did not receive support. Although EPELI was rated as more similar to everyday tasks, performance in it was not associated with the questionnaires and the diary. However, there were associations between time-monitoring behavior in EPELI and the traditional PM tasks. Taken together, online adult-EPELI was found to be a reliable method with high ecological face validity, but its convergent validity requires further research.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,,18,3,e0280717,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jylkkä, Jussi; Ritakallio, Liisa; Merzon, Liya; Kangas, Suvi; Kliegel, Matthias; Zuber, Sascha; Hering, Alexandra; Salmi, Juha; Laine, Matti","Jylkkä, Jussi (Department of Psychology, Åbo Akademi University, Turku, Finland.); Ritakallio, Liisa (Department of Psychology, Åbo Akademi University, Turku, Finland.); Merzon, Liya (Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland.); Kangas, Suvi (Department of Psychology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.); Kliegel, Matthias (Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.; Centre for the Interdisciplinary Study of Gerontology and Vulnerability, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.); Zuber, Sascha (Centre for the Interdisciplinary Study of Gerontology and Vulnerability, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.; Swiss National Center of Competences in Research LIVES-Overcoming Vulnerability: Life Course Perspectives, Lausanne & Geneva, Switzerland.); Hering, Alexandra (Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.; Department of Developmental Psychology, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands.); Salmi, Juha (Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland.; MAGICS, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland.); Laine, Matti (Department of Psychology, Åbo Akademi University, Turku, Finland.)",,"Jylkkä, Jussi (Åbo Akademi University); Ritakallio, Liisa (Åbo Akademi University); Merzon, Liya (Aalto University); Kangas, Suvi (University of Helsinki); Kliegel, Matthias (University of Geneva; University of Geneva); Zuber, Sascha (University of Geneva); Hering, Alexandra (University of Geneva; Tilburg University); Salmi, Juha (Aalto University; Aalto University); Laine, Matti (Åbo Akademi University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0280717&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368473,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,

To investigate the microbial communities on the adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) leaf surfaces, swabs were collected from both surfaces of two garden plants, Rhapis excelsa and Cordyline fruticosa. Samples were collected at noon and midnight and at five different locations to investigate if the phyllosphere microbial communities change with time and location. The abaxial surface of Rhapis excelsa and Cordyline fruticosa had fewer bacteria in contrast to its adaxial counterpart. This observation was consistent between noon and midnight and across five different locations. Our co-occurrence network analysis further showed that bacteria were found almost exclusively on the adaxial surface while only a small group of leaf blotch fungi thrived on the abaxial surface. There are higher densities of stomata on the abaxial surface and these openings are vulnerable ports of entry into the plant host. While one might argue about the settling of dust particles and microorganisms on the adaxial surface, we detected differences in reactive chemical activities and microstructures between the adaxial and abaxial surfaces. Our results further suggest that both plant species deploy different defence strategies to deter invading pathogens on the abaxial surface. We hypothesize that chemical and mechanical defence strategies evolved independently for harnessing and controlling phyllosphere microbiomes. Our findings have also advanced our understanding that the abaxial leaf surface is distinct from the adaxial surface and that the reduced microbial diversity is likely a consequence of plant-microbe interactions.","The authors would like to acknowledge Vineeth Vettath for helping with the bioinformatic analysis, Nicolas Gaultier and Enzo Acerbi for the co-occurrence analysis, Ivan Tan Chin Hin for assistance with the figures, Dr Yugen Zhang and Dr Li Guangshun for helping with the contact angle meter experiment, Vicki Yang Yanxuan for capturing the supplementary hydrophobicity videos and Chee Peng Ng and David Liebl from the IMB-IMCB Joint Electron Microscopy Suite (A*STAR Singapore) for assisting in the sample processing, image acquisition and SEM imaging in this study.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,,18,3,e0275734,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lau, Kenny J X; Gusareva, Elena S; Luhung, Irvan; Premkrishnan, Balakrishnan N V; Wong, Anthony; Poh, Tuang Yeow; Uchida, Akira; Oliveira, Elaine L; Drautz-Moses, Daniela I; Junqueira, Ana Carolina M; Schuster, Stephan C","Lau, Kenny J X (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.); Gusareva, Elena S (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.; The Asian School of the Environment, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.); Luhung, Irvan (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.); Premkrishnan, Balakrishnan N V (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.); Wong, Anthony (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.); Poh, Tuang Yeow (Translational Respiratory Research Laboratory, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.); Uchida, Akira (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.); Oliveira, Elaine L (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.); Drautz-Moses, Daniela I (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.); Junqueira, Ana Carolina M (Departamento de Genética, Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.); Schuster, Stephan C (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.)",,"Lau, Kenny J X (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering); Gusareva, Elena S (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering; Nanyang Technological University); Luhung, Irvan (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering); Premkrishnan, Balakrishnan N V (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering); Wong, Anthony (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering); Poh, Tuang Yeow (Nanyang Technological University); Uchida, Akira (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering); Oliveira, Elaine L (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering); Drautz-Moses, Daniela I (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering); Junqueira, Ana Carolina M (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro); Schuster, Stephan C (Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0275734&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368484,31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3108 Plant Biology,

It is recognised that burnout may be associated with psychopathological sequelae, such as symptoms of anxiety and depression.
AIMS: This study aimed to examine the relationship between burnout and symptoms of depression and anxiety in senior doctors in Ireland. We examined personality traits as a mediating factor on burnout, in relation to work related stress among the participants.
METHODS: This study was a national cross sectional survey of consultants. Data included basic demographic data, work-related data, burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory, personality traits, and symptoms of depression and anxiety from the Depressive Anxiety Stress Scale [DASS].
RESULTS: Results were obtained from 477 consultants, yielding a response rate 21.9%. Nearly half (42%) reported high burnout levels. Over one-quarter (25.8%) screened positive for depression and 13.8% for anxiety. After controlling for gender and age, depressive symptoms were associated with high levels of emotional exhaustion (p<0.001) and a higher clinical workload, and stress with cynicism and reduced professional efficacy (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The this study reported a high level of work-related burnout, associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety in senior doctors. This is concerning, and strategies are required that consider the relationship between symptoms of depression/anxiety and burnout. Further research to evaluate strategies to ensure physician wellbeing and optimal delivery of patient care are required to address this serious problem.","The authors acknowledge the Irish Hospital Consultants Association for allowing access to the membership email, and to its members for participating in this study.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,,18,3,e0276027,All OA; Gold,Article,"Crudden, Genevieve; Margiotta, Fabio; Doherty, Anne M","Crudden, Genevieve (Department of Liaison Psychiatry, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Psychiatry, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.); Margiotta, Fabio (Department of Psychiatry, Townsville University Hospital, Queensland, Australia.); Doherty, Anne M (Department of Liaison Psychiatry, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Psychiatry, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.)",,"Crudden, Genevieve (Mater Misericordiae University Hospital; University College Dublin); Margiotta, Fabio (Townsville Hospital); Doherty, Anne M (Mater Misericordiae University Hospital; University College Dublin)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0276027&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368461,42 Health Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

A wide range of context-specific factors may influence these differences and change over time. We compared TB treatment in regional and metropolitan areas, considering demographic and temporal trends affecting TB diagnosis and outcomes.
METHODS: Retrospective analyses of data for patients notified with TB in Victoria, Australia, were conducted. The study outcomes were treatment delays and treatment outcomes. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard model analyses were performed to investigate the effect of regionality in the management of TB. Six hundred and eleven (7%) TB patients were notified in regional and 8,163 (93%) in metropolitan areas between 1995 and 2019. Of the 611 cases in the regional cohort, 401 (66%) were overseas-born. Fifty-one percent of the overseas-born patients in regional Victoria developed TB disease within five years of arrival in Australia. Four cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were reported in regional areas, compared to 97 cases in metropolitan areas. A total of 3,238 patients notified from 2012 to 2019 were included in the survival analysis. The time follow-up for patient delay started at symptom onset date, and the event was the presentation to the healthcare centre. For healthcare system delay, follow-up time began at the presentation to the healthcare centre, and the event was commenced on TB treatment. Cases with extrapulmonary TB in regional areas have a non-significantly longer healthcare system delay than patients in metropolitan (median 64 days versus 54 days, AHR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-1.0, P = 0.094).
CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis in regional Victoria is common among the overseas-born population, and patients with extrapulmonary TB in regional areas experienced a non-significant minor delay in treatment commencement with no apparent detriment to treatment outcomes. Improving access to LTBI management in regional areas may reduce the burden of TB.",The authors would like to thank the clinical nurse consultants for collecting and entering data into the database.

The dangerous and wasteful effects are substantial, and the probability of attacks is very high. Therefore, an anomaly detection and protection system are needed. This paper aims to design and implement an intelligent anomaly detection system for the security of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones. The proposed system is heavily based on utilizing ICMetric technology to exploit low-level device features for detection. This technology extracts the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors' bias to create a unique number known as the ICMetric number. Hence, ICMetric numbers represent additional features integrated into the dataset used to detect drones. This study performs the classification using a deep neural network (DNN).

One challenge in such systems is that they are potentially susceptible to the influences of contaminating microbes in test materials. Simulated gastric and intestinal digestion can relieve some of these concerns, however, live microbes may remain that can confound analysis. Autoclave treatment of test materials is the surest way to eliminate these microbes but presents problems when using heat labile components such as resistant starch. In this study, liquid chemical sterilant alternatives to moist heat sterilization were explored for treating pulse flours for use during in vitro simulated colon fermentation. Key attributes considered in chemical selection were accessibility, impact on treated food components, and effectiveness of the treatments for reducing microbial load. Three chemicals were selected for evaluation, bleach, alcohol, and hydrogen peroxide, at varying concentrations. Flours chosen for testing were from green lentil, field pea, chickpea, or sprouted green lentil. All treatments significantly reduced microbial loads, though there were still detectable levels of microbes after alcohol treatments. Furthermore, in vitro simulated colon fermentations of the treated pulses showed minimal difference from the untreated control both in terms of microbial composition and short chain fatty acid production. Scanning electron microscopy showed minimal impact of sterilization treatments on the gross structure of the pulse flours. Together these results suggest that bleach and hydrogen peroxide treatments can be effective nonthermal treatments to eliminate contaminating microbes in pulse flours without causing significant damage to starch and other fermentable substrates. This is thus also a promising treatment method for other starchy food substrates, though further testing is required.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,,18,3,e0283287,All OA; Gold,Article,"Paff, Andrew; Cockburn, Darrell W","Paff, Andrew (Department of Food Science, College of Agricultural Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, United States of America.); Cockburn, Darrell W (Department of Food Science, College of Agricultural Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, United States of America.)",,"Paff, Andrew (Pennsylvania State University); Cockburn, Darrell W (Pennsylvania State University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283287&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368478,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences",

DSRABSQL builds upon the Q-learning (QL) algorithm. Considering its problems of slow convergence and low accuracy, four strategies within the QL framework are designed first: the weighting function-based reward matrix, the power function-based initial Q-table, a self-adaptive ε-beam search strategy, and a new Q-value update formula. Then, a self-adaptive beam search Q-learning (ABSQL) algorithm is designed. To solve the problem that the sub-route is not fully optimized in the ABSQL algorithm, a dynamic sub-route optimization strategy is introduced outside the QL framework, and then the DSRABSQL algorithm is designed. Experiments are conducted to compare QL, ABSQL, DSRABSQL, our previously proposed variable neighborhood discrete whale optimization algorithm, and two advanced reinforcement learning algorithms. The experimental results show that DSRABSQL significantly outperforms the other algorithms. In addition, two groups of algorithms are designed based on the QL and DSRABSQL algorithms to test the effectiveness of the five strategies. From the experimental results, it can be found that the dynamic sub-route optimization strategy and self-adaptive ε-beam search strategy contribute the most for small-, medium-, and large-scale instances. At the same time, collaboration exists between the four strategies within the QL framework, which increases with the expansion of the instance scale.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,,18,3,e0283207,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhang, Jin; Liu, Qing; Han, XiaoHang","Zhang, Jin (School of Computer and Information Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan, China.; Henan Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Processing, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan, China.); Liu, Qing (School of Computer and Information Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan, China.); Han, XiaoHang (School of Computer and Information Engineering, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan, China.)",,"Zhang, Jin (Henan University; Henan University); Liu, Qing (Henan University); Han, XiaoHang (Henan University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283207&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368477,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4611 Machine Learning,

However, when stratified by sex, the relationship between microalbuminuria and CVD remains unclear.
METHOD: We obtained data from the 2011-2014 and 2019-2020 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Microalbuminuria was measured based on spot urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR). The Framingham risk score (FRS) model was implemented to evaluate the CVD risk. Linear and logistic regression models were used to identify the associations of microalbuminuria status with cardiometabolic predictors and CVD status determined by the FRS score.
RESULTS: Among 19,340 representative Korean participants, the (UACR) in Korean women and men with history of CVD was higher than in those without history of CVD. Among patients without history of CVD, multivariate regression analysis showed that a high UACR was related to older age, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, higher total cholesterol level, higher systolic blood pressure, higher prevalence of current smoking, higher prevalence of diabetes, and higher anti-hypertensive medication use in both women and men. The UACR showed a positive linear correlation with the Framingham risk score in both women and men.

In two studies, we measured self-reported format preference for statistical vs. anecdotal information in vaccine hesitant individuals, and experimentally manipulated the format in which COVID-19 and influenza vaccine hesitancy interventions were presented (statistical vs. anecdotal). Regardless of whether people received interventions that were in line with their format preference, the interventions did not influence their vaccine attitudes or vaccination intentions. Instead, a stronger preference for anecdotal information was associated with perceiving the material in both the statistical and the anecdotal interventions as more frustrating, less relevant, and less helpful. However, even if the participants reacted negatively to both intervention formats, the reactions to the statistical interventions were consistently less negative. These results suggest that tailoring COVID-19 and influenza vaccine hesitancy interventions to suit people's format preference, might not be a viable tool for decreasing vaccine hesitancy.

Abortion is available at public facilities at no cost and by trained private providers. Yet, over half of abortions are provided outside this legal system. We sought to investigate the extent to which patients are denied an abortion at clinics legally able to provide services and factors associated with presenting late for care, being denied, and receiving an abortion after being denied.
METHODS: We used data from a prospective longitudinal study with 1835 women aged 15-45. Between April 2019 and December 2020, we recruited 1,835 women seeking abortions at 22 sites across Nepal, including those seeking care at any gestational age (n = 537) and then only those seeking care at or after 10 weeks of gestation or do not know their gestational age (n = 1,298). We conducted interviewer-led surveys with these women at the time they were seeking abortion service (n = 1,835), at six weeks after abortion-seeking (n = 1523) and six-month intervals for three years. Using descriptive and multivariable logistic regression models, we examined factors associated with presenting for abortion before versus after 10 weeks gestation, with receiving versus being denied an abortion, and with continuing the pregnancy after being denied care. We also described reasons for the denial of care and how and where participants sought abortion care subsequent to being denied. Mixed-effects models was used to accounting clustering effect at the facility level.
RESULTS: Among those recruited when eligibility included seeking abortion at any gestational age, four in ten women sought abortion care beyond 10 weeks or did not know their gestation and just over one in ten was denied care. Of the full sample, 73% were at or beyond 10 weeks gestation, 44% were denied care, and 60% of those denied continued to seek care after denial. Nearly three-quarters of those denied care were legally eligible for abortion, based on their gestation and pre-existing conditions. Women with lower socioeconomic status, including those who were younger, less educated, and less wealthy, were more likely to present later for abortion, more likely to be turned away, and more likely to continue the pregnancy after denial of care.
CONCLUSION: Denial of legal abortion care in Nepal is common, particularly among those with fewer resources. The majority of those denied in the sample should have been able to obtain care according to Nepal's abortion law. Abortion denial could have significant potential implications for the health and well-being of women and their families in Nepal.","We would like to thank all of the field researchers who did the primary recruitment and data collection, the study sites, members of the national technical advisory committee, and the participants for their time.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,,18,3,e0282886,All OA; Gold,Article,"Puri, Mahesh C; Raifman, Sarah; Daniel, Sara; Karki, Sunita; Maharjan, Dev Chandra; Ahlbach, Chris; Diamond-Smith, Nadia; Foster, Diana Greene","Puri, Mahesh C (Center for Research on Environment, Health and Population Activities (CREHPA), Kathmandu, Nepal.); Raifman, Sarah (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, California, United States of America.); Daniel, Sara (Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.); Karki, Sunita (Center for Research on Environment, Health and Population Activities (CREHPA), Kathmandu, Nepal.); Maharjan, Dev Chandra (Center for Research on Environment, Health and Population Activities (CREHPA), Kathmandu, Nepal.); Ahlbach, Chris (School of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America.); Diamond-Smith, Nadia (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, California, United States of America.); Foster, Diana Greene (Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, Reproductive Sciences, Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, University of California, San Francisco, California, United States of America.)",,"Puri, Mahesh C (); Raifman, Sarah (University of California, San Francisco); Daniel, Sara (Johns Hopkins University); Karki, Sunita (); Maharjan, Dev Chandra (); Ahlbach, Chris (University of California, San Francisco); Diamond-Smith, Nadia (University of California, San Francisco); Foster, Diana Greene (University of California, San Francisco)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282886&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368459,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,3 Good Health and Well Being

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to define factors affecting distant metastasis in patients with surgically treated HPV-positive tonsil cancer.
METHODS: The present study enrolled 76 patients diagnosed with HPV-positive tonsil cancer who underwent primary surgery between January 2010 and December 2021.
RESULTS: Twelve (15.7%) patients experienced a distant failure with a median follow-up time of 43 months. Sites of distant metastasis included the lung (n = 10), liver (n = 1), and brain (n = 1). Upon multivariate analysis, an advanced T stage (odds ratio [OR]: 13.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-149.863, p = 0.003) and margin involvement (OR: 5.96, 95% CI: 1.33-26.76, p = 0.02) were independent predictors of distant metastases. The five-year disease-specific survival for the entire cohort was 85%. The multivariate analysis confirmed that distant metastasis (hazard ratio [HR]: 12.688, 95% CI: 3.424-47.016; p < 0.001) and margin involvement (HR: 6.243; 95% CI: 1.681-23.191; p = 0.006) were significant factors associated with the five-year disease-specific survival.
CONCLUSION: HPV-positive tonsil cancer patients with an advanced T stage and a positive surgical margin have a substantial risk of distant metastases.

In this study, we investigate the cortico-striatal circuitry involved in learning and the role of this circuitry in the emergence of inflexible behaviors such as those observed in addiction. Specifically, we develop a computational model of cortico-striatal interactions that performs concurrent goal-directed and habit learning. The model accomplishes this by distinguishing learning processes in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) that rely on reward prediction error signals as distinct from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) where learning is supported by salience signals. These striatal subregions each operate on unique cortical input: the DMS receives input from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) which represents outcomes, and the DLS receives input from the premotor cortex which determines action selection. Following an initial learning of a two-alternative forced choice task, we subjected the model to reversal learning, reward devaluation, and learning a punished outcome. Behavior driven by stimulus-response associations in the DLS resisted goal-directed learning of new reward feedback rules despite devaluation or punishment, indicating the expression of habit. We repeated these simulations after the impairment of executive control, which was implemented as poor outcome representation in the PFC. The degraded executive control reduced the efficacy of goal-directed learning, and stimulus-response associations in the DLS were even more resistant to the learning of new reward feedback rules. In summary, this model describes how circuits of the dorsal striatum are dynamically engaged to control behavior and how the impairment of executive control by the PFC enhances inflexible behavior.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,,18,3,e0279841,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barnett, William H; Kuznetsov, Alexey; Lapish, Christopher C","Barnett, William H (Department of Psychology, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.); Kuznetsov, Alexey (Department of Mathematics, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.); Lapish, Christopher C (Department of Psychology, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.; Stark Neurosciences Research Institute, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.)",,"Barnett, William H (Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis); Kuznetsov, Alexey (Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis); Lapish, Christopher C (Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis; Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0279841&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368482,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,

METHODS: Eligibility criteria: Original studies comparing digital physiotherapy assessment with face-to-face physiotherapy assessment of musculoskeletal disorders. Systematic database searches were performed in May 2021, and updated in May 2022, in Medline, Cochrane Library, Cinahl, AMED, and PEDro. Risk of bias and applicability of the included studies were appraised using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool and the Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies tool. Included studies were synthesised narratively. Certainty of evidence was evaluated for each assessment component using GRADE.
RESULTS: Ten repeated-measures studies were included, involving 193 participants aged 23-62 years. Reported validity of digital physiotherapy assessment ranged from moderate/acceptable to almost perfect/excellent for clinical tests, range of motion, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), pain, neck posture, and management decisions. Reported validity for assessing spinal posture varied and was for clinical observations unacceptably low. Reported validity and reliability for digital diagnosis ranged from moderate to almost perfect for exact+similar agreement, but was considerably lower when constrained to exact agreement. Reported reliability was excellent for digital assessment of clinical tests, range of motion, pain, neck posture, and PROMs. Certainty of evidence varied from very low to high, with PROMs and pain assessment obtaining the highest certainty. Patients were satisfied with their digital assessment, but did not perceive it as good as face-to-face assessment.
DISCUSSION: Evidence ranging from very low to high certainty suggests that validity and reliability of digital physiotherapy assessments are acceptable to excellent for several assessment components. Digital physiotherapy assessment may be a viable alternative to face-to-face assessment for patients who are likely to benefit from the accessibility and convenience of remote access.

The path loss helps to determine the network's geographic coverage. Although many path loss models, including statistical and empirical models based on measurement and linear regression, have been proposed by various researchers, high fidelity is required to determine the performance of the wireless network's channel. This research validates the improved version of the well-known close in (CI) and floating intercept (FI) path loss models at frequency bands of 28 and 38 GHz. The measurement surroundings comprised of an enclosed passageway with vertical-horizontal (V-H) and vertical-vertical (V-V) antenna polarizations. One of the key findings of this study is that the enhanced versions of these models typically perform better in terms of consistency than the standard models thereby justifying their high accuracy level. The improved versions of the CI and the FI models demonstrate a significant improvement for various antenna polarizations. The mean prediction error (MPE) and standard deviation error (SDE) also show how precisely and accurately the improved models predict the path loss. Additionally, the improved models provide the reasonable responsiveness and uniformity of the parameters with the change in the antenna polarization and lower the shadow fading's standard deviation in LOS as well as NLOS situations. The results confirm that the modified versions of CI and FI models predict path loss better in an enclosed environment for 5G networks.","Authors would like to thank Mr Elliot Umory, a postgraduate student, for his assistance during the measurement campaign.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,,18,3,e0283005,All OA; Gold,Article,"Oladimeji, Tolulope T; Kumar, Pradeep; Elmezughi, Mohamed K","Oladimeji, Tolulope T (Discipline of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.); Kumar, Pradeep (Discipline of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.); Elmezughi, Mohamed K (Discipline of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.)",,"Oladimeji, Tolulope T (University of KwaZulu-Natal); Kumar, Pradeep (University of KwaZulu-Natal); Elmezughi, Mohamed K (University of KwaZulu-Natal)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283005&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368474,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,

Under the environmental stress, corals can experience tissue loss and/or the breakdown of symbiosis between the cnidarian host and its symbiotic algae causing the coral tissue to appear white as the skeleton can be seen by transparency. Image analysis is a common method used to assess tissue response under the environmental stress. However, the traditional approach is limited by the dynamic nature of the coral-algae symbiosis. Here, we observed coral tissue response in the scleractinian coral, Montipora capricornis, using high frequency image analysis throughout the experiment, as opposed to the typical start/end point assessment method. Color analysis reveals that the process can be divided into five stages with two critical stages according to coral tissue morphology and color ratio. We further explore changes to the morphology of individual polyps by means of the Pearson correlation coefficient and recurrence plots, where the quasi-periodic and nonstationary dynamics can be identified. The recurrence quantification analysis also allows the comparison between the different polyps. Our research provides a detailed visual and mathematical analysis of coral tissue response to environmental stress, which potentially shows universal applicability.

Leaves.,"The fresh leaves of Mitragyna speciosa (Korth.) Havil. have been traditionally consumed for centuries in Southeast Asia for its healing properties. Although the alkaloids of M. speciosa have been studied since the 1920s, comparative and systematic studies of metabolite composition based on different leaf maturity levels are still lacking. This study assessed the secondary metabolite composition in two different leaf stages (young and mature) of M. speciosa, using an untargeted liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-TOF-MS) metabolite profiling. The results revealed 86 putatively annotated metabolite features (RT:m/z value) comprising 63 alkaloids, 10 flavonoids, 6 terpenoids, 3 phenylpropanoids, and 1 of each carboxylic acid, glucoside, phenol, and phenolic aldehyde. The alkaloid features were further categorised into 14 subclasses, i.e., the most abundant class of secondary metabolites identified. As per previous reports, indole alkaloids are the most abundant alkaloid subclass in M. speciosa. The result of multivariate analysis (MVA) using principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear separation of 92.8% between the young and mature leaf samples, indicating a high variance in metabolite levels between them. Akuammidine, alstonine, tryptamine, and yohimbine were tentatively identified among the many new alkaloids reported in this study, depicting the diverse biological activities of M. speciosa. Besides delving into the knowledge of metabolite distribution in different leaf stages, these findings have extended the current alkaloid repository of M. speciosa for a better understanding of its pharmaceutical potential.","The authors would like to thank Prof. Emeritus Dr Ikram Bin Mohd Said (Faculty of Science and Technology, UKM), for the useful discussion and Pn.

The objectives were two-fold: to assess the durability of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection among initially unvaccinated individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to evaluate the crude SARS-CoV-2 reinfection rate and associated risk factors. During the pandemic era time period from February 29, 2020, through April 30, 2021, 144,678,382 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic or antibody test results were studied. Rates of reinfection among index-positive individuals were compared to rates of infection among index-negative individuals. Factors associated with reinfection were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. For both objectives, the outcome was a subsequent positive molecular diagnostic test result. Consistent with prior findings, the risk of reinfection among index-positive individuals was 87% lower than the risk of infection among index-negative individuals.

The egg coat is well known for its potential importance in both the reproduction and early development, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Interestingly, ZP3, one of the ZP-glycoprotein family members forming scaffolds of the egg-coat matrices with other ZP glycoproteins, exhibits extreme but distinctive microheterogeneity to form a large number of isoelectric-point isoforms at least in the chicken IPVL. In the present study, we performed three-dimensional confocal imaging and two-dimensional polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) of chicken IPVLs that were isolated from the ovarian follicles at different growth stages before ovulation. The results suggest that the relative proportions of the ZP3 isoforms are differentially altered during the structural maturation of the egg-coat matrices. Furthermore, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses and ZP1 binding assays against separated ZP3 isoforms demonstrated that each ZP3 isoform contains characteristic modifications, and there are large differences among ZP3 isoforms in the ZP1 binding affinities. These results suggest that the microheterogeneity of chicken ZP3 might be regulated to be associated with the formation of egg-coat matrices during the structural maturation of chicken IPVL. Our findings may provide new insights into molecular mechanisms of egg-coat assembly processes.",We would like to thank Dr. Luca Jovine of Karolinska Institutet for helpful discussions and suggestions regarding the manuscript.,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,,18,3,e0283087,All OA; Gold,Article,"Okumura, Hiroki; Mizuno, Ayaka; Iwamoto, Eri; Sakuma, Rio; Nishio, Shunsuke; Nishijima, Ken-Ichi; Matsuda, Tsukasa; Ujita, Minoru","Okumura, Hiroki (Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.); Mizuno, Ayaka (Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.); Iwamoto, Eri (Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.); Sakuma, Rio (Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.); Nishio, Shunsuke (Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.); Nishijima, Ken-Ichi (Avian Bioscience Research Center, Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Tokai National Higher Education and Research System, Nagoya, Japan.); Matsuda, Tsukasa (Faculty of Food and Agricultural Sciences, Fukushima University, Fukushima, Japan.); Ujita, Minoru (Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.)",,"Okumura, Hiroki (Meijo University); Mizuno, Ayaka (Meijo University); Iwamoto, Eri (Meijo University); Sakuma, Rio (Meijo University); Nishio, Shunsuke (Karolinska Institute); Nishijima, Ken-Ichi (Nagoya University); Matsuda, Tsukasa (Fukushima University); Ujita, Minoru (Meijo University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283087&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368469,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,

Thirteen male swimmers were recruited and performed a 200 m breaststroke in a pre-calibrated 25 m pool. Sub-phases during the underwater segment were obtained using a notational analysis, and the mean velocity, displacement and duration during each sub-phase were obtained. A hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed using the analysed variables in all phases to identify inter-individual variability and random intra-individual variability. In addition, a linear mixed model (LMM: lap as a fixed effect and the participant as a random effect) was conducted to investigate systematic intra-individual variability. HCA identified three coordination patterns that were distinguished by the timing of the dolphin kick relative to the arm pull-out and the duration of the glide with arms at the side. All swimmers except one performed the arm pull-out after the dolphin kick. Nine swimmers maintained one coordination pattern, but other swimmers switched their coordination during the trial, particularly by shortening the duration of the glide with arms at the side. LMM showed a linear decrease (from the first to the last turn) in the time gap between the end of the dolphin kick and the start of the arm pull-out (a glide with the streamlined body position; F = 9.64, p = 0.034) and the glide duration with the arms at the side (F = 11.66, p = 0.015). In conclusion, both inter- and intra-individual variabilities during the underwater phase were evident in 200 m breaststroke turns, which were categorised into three patterns based on the timing of the dolphin kick and the duration of glides.",,,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,,18,3,e0283234,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gonjo, Tomohiro; Olstad, Bjørn Harald; Šťastný, Jan; Conceição, Ana; Seifert, Ludovic","Gonjo, Tomohiro (Department of Rehabilitation & Sport Sciences, Bournemouth University, Poole, United Kingdom.); Olstad, Bjørn Harald (Department of Physical Performance, Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, Oslo, Norway.); Šťastný, Jan (Centre of Sports Activities, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic.); Conceição, Ana (Sport Sciences School of Rio Maior, Rio Maior, Portugal.; Research Centre of Sports, Health and Human Development (CIDESD), Rio Maior, Portugal.); Seifert, Ludovic (CETAPS EA3832, Faculty of Sport Sciences, University of Rouen Normandie, Mont Saint Aignan, France.; Institut Universitaire de France (IUF), Paris, France.)",,"Gonjo, Tomohiro (Bournemouth University); Olstad, Bjørn Harald (Norwegian School of Sport Sciences); Šťastný, Jan (Brno University of Technology); Conceição, Ana (); Seifert, Ludovic (University of Rouen; Institut Universitaire de France)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283234&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368457,42 Health Sciences; 4207 Sports Science and Exercise,

DESIGN: A discrimination task consisting of 33 minimal pairs in monosyllabic words was designed to explore the development of consonant discrimination in five test conditions: 0, -5, -10, -15 dB S/Ns, and quiet.
STUDY SAMPLE: Forty Mandarin-speaking, normal-hearing children aged from 4;0 to 8;9 in one-year-age increment were recruited and their performance was compared to 10 adult listeners.
RESULTS: A significant main effect of age, test conditions, and an interaction effect between these variables was noted. Consonant discrimination in quiet and in noise improved as children became older. Consonants that were difficult to discriminate in quiet and in noise were mainly velar contrasts. Noise seemed to have less effect on the discrimination of affricates and fricatives, and plosives appeared to be to be more difficult to discriminate in noise than in quiet. Place contrasts between alveolar and palato-alveolar consonants were difficult in quiet.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings were the first to reveal typical perceptual development of Mandarin consonant discrimination in children and can serve as a reference for comparison with children with disordered perceptual development, such as those with hearing loss.",The authors are grateful to the children and their parents for participation in the study.

The objective of this meta-study was to evaluate how PIK3CA exon 9/20 mutations affect survival in endometrial cancer patients, based on available literature. Topic-based search strategies were applied to databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and COSMIC. All studies assessing the impact of mutations in exon 9 and exon 20 of PIK3CA on survival rates of endometrial cancer patients were selected for inclusion. Statistical meta-analysis was performed with the 'meta' package in RStudio. Overall, 7 of 612 screened articles were included in the present study, comprising 1098 women with endometrial cancer. Meta-analysis revealed a tendency of impaired survival for patients with PIK3CA exon 9 and/or exon 20 mutations (RR 1.28; 95% CI 0.84, 1.94; p = 0.25). This tendency was consistent in subgroup analyses stratified by histologic type or -grade, with the most prominent effect in low-grade endometrial cancers (RR 2.04; 95% CI 0.90, 4.62; p = 0.09).

Thus, other alternatives to fight against S. aureus infections are necessary; and combinatory therapy of antibiotics with natural compounds is one of the approaches. This study evaluated the activity of the combination of mallotojaponin B and chloramphenicol against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Antibacterial activities were evaluated by broth microdilution and the checkerboard methods. Modes of action as time-kill kinetic, Nucleotide leakage, inhibition and eradication of biofilm, and loss of salt tolerance were evaluated. Cytotoxicity was evaluated on Vero and Raw cell lines. Mallotojaponin B showed good activity against MRSA with a MIC value of 12.5 μg/mL. MRSA showed high resistance to chloramphenicol (MIC = 250 μg/mL). The combination produced a synergistic effect with a mean FICI of 0.393. This combination was bactericidal, inducing nucleotide leakage, inhibiting biofilm formation, and eradicating biofilm formed by MRSA. The synergic combination was non-cytotoxic to Vero and Raw cell lines. Thus, the combination of mallotojaponin B and chloramphenicol could be a potential alternative to design a new drug against MRSA infections.","The authors are thankful to the Centre Pasteur of Cameroon (CPC) for providing the Vero cell lines ATCC CRL 158 (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells), as well as the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, the University of Ghana for the Raw 264.7 cell lines.",,PLOS ONE,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,,18,3,e0282008,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nguena-Dongue, Branly-Natalien; Tchamgoue, Joseph; Ngandjui Tchangoue, Yvan Anderson; Lunga, Paul Keilah; Toghueo, Kouipou Rufin Marie; Zeuko O, Menkem Elisabeth; Melogmo, Yanick Kevin Dongmo; Tchouankeu, Jean Claude; Kouam, Simeon Fogue; Fekam, Boyom Fabrice","Nguena-Dongue, Branly-Natalien (Antimicrobial and Biocontrol Agents Unit (AmBcAU), Laboratory for Phytobiochemistry and Medicinal Plants Studies, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaoundé I, Yaoundé, Cameroon.); Tchamgoue, Joseph (Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaoundé I, Yaoundé, Cameroon.); Ngandjui Tchangoue, Yvan Anderson (Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaoundé I, Yaoundé, Cameroon.; Department of Chemistry, Higher Teacher Training College, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon.); Lunga, Paul Keilah (Antimicrobial and Biocontrol Agents Unit (AmBcAU), Laboratory for Phytobiochemistry and Medicinal Plants Studies, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaoundé I, Yaoundé, Cameroon.); Toghueo, Kouipou Rufin Marie (Antimicrobial and Biocontrol Agents Unit (AmBcAU), Laboratory for Phytobiochemistry and Medicinal Plants Studies, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaoundé I, Yaoundé, Cameroon.); Zeuko O, Menkem Elisabeth (Antimicrobial and Biocontrol Agents Unit (AmBcAU), Laboratory for Phytobiochemistry and Medicinal Plants Studies, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaoundé I, Yaoundé, Cameroon.); Melogmo, Yanick Kevin Dongmo (Antimicrobial and Biocontrol Agents Unit (AmBcAU), Laboratory for Phytobiochemistry and Medicinal Plants Studies, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaoundé I, Yaoundé, Cameroon.); Tchouankeu, Jean Claude (Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaoundé I, Yaoundé, Cameroon.); Kouam, Simeon Fogue (Department of Chemistry, Higher Teacher Training College, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon.); Fekam, Boyom Fabrice (Antimicrobial and Biocontrol Agents Unit (AmBcAU), Laboratory for Phytobiochemistry and Medicinal Plants Studies, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaoundé I, Yaoundé, Cameroon.)",,"Nguena-Dongue, Branly-Natalien (University of Yaoundé I); Tchamgoue, Joseph (University of Yaoundé I); Ngandjui Tchangoue, Yvan Anderson (University of Yaoundé I; University of Yaoundé I); Lunga, Paul Keilah (University of Yaoundé I); Toghueo, Kouipou Rufin Marie (University of Yaoundé I); Zeuko O, Menkem Elisabeth (University of Yaoundé I); Melogmo, Yanick Kevin Dongmo (University of Yaoundé I); Tchouankeu, Jean Claude (University of Yaoundé I); Kouam, Simeon Fogue (University of Yaoundé I); Fekam, Boyom Fabrice (University of Yaoundé I)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282008&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368471,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being

Organizations such as the Oathkeepers and 3 Percenters (also known as III%ers) in the United States have grown significantly in the last two decades, while paramilitary organizations playing a key role in both offensive and defensive actions in Crimea and the Donbas Region have become a focus of discussion in the Russian war on Ukraine. Although they have not always garnered as much attention, paramilitary organizations in Central and Eastern Europe have a long history. While most are relatively inactive, others play a wide variety of active roles, sometimes even running operations in parallel with a state's official armed forces (e.g., the PMO serving the state in Poland, or the Night Wolves helping Russia capture Crimea). Despite the increase in the number and activity of these paramilitary organizations, little is known about the personal, social, moral, and psychological background of the individuals who join them. After reviewing the history and ideology of the largest paramilitary organization in the Slovak Republic, this article presents and discusses the results of a survey administered to the group. This survey used different measures of personality, morality, and identity, as well as information about respondents' personal background, family history, socio-economic status, and political ideology.

Herein, we have designed a pyrene-decorated Cu(I) complex with a rare dual emission behavior, aiming at additional π-interaction with a pyrene-appended Co(II) catalyst for visible light-driven CO2-to-CO conversion. The results of 1H NMR titration, time-resolved fluorescence/absorption spectroscopies, quantum chemical simulations, and photocatalytic experiments clearly demonstrate that the dynamic π-π interaction between sensitizer and catalyst is highly advantageous in photocatalysis by accelerating the intermolecular electron transfer rate up to 6.9 × 105 s-1, thus achieving a notable apparent quantum yield of 19% at 425 nm with near-unity selectivity.

The ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is calculated by comparing the ankle and brachial blood pressure (BP). However, it is currently unclear whether brachial BP measurements provided by automated PAD screening systems are sufficiently accurate for simultaneous hypertension screening.
METHODS: Two portable PAD screening devices, the MESI ABPI MD and Huntleigh's Dopplex ABIlity, were evaluated following the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol (ESH-IP) Revision 2010 using a mercury-free sphygmomanometer as a reference device.
RESULTS: On average, the MESI slightly underestimated brachial systolic blood pressure (BP) with a bias and standard deviation (SD) of -3.5 (SD: 3.3) mmHg and diastolic BP with a bias of -1.5 (SD: 2.3) mmHg. For systolic BP estimates, the Dopplex was more accurate than the MESI with a lower bias of -0.5 (SD: 4.2) mmHg but less precise. The MESI successfully fulfilled all the requirements of the ESH-IP for hypertension screening. The Dopplex device failed the ESH-IP due to the absence of DBP measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: The MESI device appears to be suitable for simultaneous PAD and hypertension screening as part of a preventative care programme. Huntleigh's Dopplex ABIlity failed to pass the ESH-IP validation test.

Text mining can offer researchers access to existing or new datasets, sourced from social media or from IPV-related organisations, that would be too large to analyse manually. This article aims to give an overview of current work applying text mining methodologies in the study of IPV, as a starting point for researchers wanting to use such methods in their own work.MethodsThis article reports the results of a systematic review of academic research using computational text mining to research IPV. A review protocol was developed according to PRISMA guidelines, and a literature search of 8 databases was conducted, identifying 22 unique studies that were included in the review.ResultsThe included studies cover a wide range of methodologies and outcomes. Supervised and unsupervised approaches are represented, including rule-based classification (n = 3), traditional Machine Learning (n = 8), Deep Learning (n = 6) and topic modelling (n = 4) methods. Datasets are mostly sourced from social media (n = 15), with other data being sourced from police forces (n = 3), health or social care providers (n = 3), or litigation texts (n = 1). Evaluation methods mostly used a held-out, labelled test set, or k-fold Cross Validation, with Accuracy and F1 metrics reported. Only a few studies commented on the ethics of computational IPV research.ConclusionsText mining methodologies offer promising data collection and analysis techniques for IPV research. Future work in this space must consider ethical implications of computational approaches.",,"Whilst conducting and at the time of submitting this research, Lilly Neubauer was funded by an EPSRC studentship in Cybersecurity, grant number EP/S022503/1.

The current research tested the association between personal values and romantic relationship quality while considering potential mediating mechanisms related to pro-relational attitudes, communal strength, intrinsic relationship motivation, and entitlement. Across five studies using different measures of value priorities, we found that the endorsement of self-transcendence values (i.e., benevolence, universalism) was related to higher romantic relationship quality. The findings provided support for the mediating roles of pro-relational attitudes, communal strength, and intrinsic relationship motivation. Finally, a dyadic analysis in our fifth study showed that self-transcendence values mostly influence a person's own relationship quality but not that of their partner.

Chemotactically controlled motility in viscous milieu allows targeted navigation to intestinal mucus and colonization. By phase variation, quorum sensing, extensive O-and N-glycosylation and use of the flagellum as type-3-secretion system C. jejuni adapts effectively to environmental conditions. C. jejuni utilizes proteases to open cell–cell junctions and subsequently transmigrates paracellularly. Fibronectin at the basolateral side of polarized epithelial cells serves as binding site for adhesins CadF and FlpA, leading to intracellular signaling, which again triggers membrane ruffling and reduced host cell migration by focal adhesion. Cell contacts of C. jejuni results in its secretion of invasion antigens, which induce membrane ruffling by paxillin-independent pathway. In addition to fibronectin-binding proteins, other adhesins with other target structures and lectins and their corresponding sugar structures are involved in host–pathogen interaction. Invasion into the intestinal epithelial cell depends on host cell structures. Fibronectin, clathrin, and dynein influence cytoskeletal restructuring, endocytosis, and vesicular transport, through different mechanisms. C. jejuni can persist over a 72-h period in the cell. Campylobacter-containing vacuoles, avoid fusion with lysosomes and enter the perinuclear space via dynein, inducing signaling pathways. Secretion of cytolethal distending toxin directs the cell into programmed cell death, including the pyroptotic release of proinflammatory substances from the destroyed cell compartments. The immune system reacts with an inflammatory cascade by participation of numerous immune cells. The development of autoantibodies, directed not only against lipooligosaccharides, but also against endogenous gangliosides, triggers autoimmune diseases. Lesions of the epithelium result in loss of electrolytes, water, and blood, leading to diarrhea, which flushes out mucus containing C. jejuni. Together with the response of the immune system, this limits infection time. Based on the structural interactions between host cell and bacterium, the numerous virulence mechanisms, signaling, and effects that characterize the infection process of C. jejuni, a wide variety of targets for attenuation of the pathogen can be characterized. The review summarizes strategies of C. jejuni for host–pathogen interaction and should stimulate innovative research towards improved definition of targets for future drug development.Key points• Bacterial adhesion of Campylobacter to host cells and invasion into host cells are strictly coordinated processes, which can serve as targets to prevent infection.• Reaction and signalling of host cell depend on the cell type.• Campylobacter virulence factors can be used as targets for development of antivirulence drug compounds.",,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,2023-03-21,,,1-30,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Kemper, Leon; Hensel, Andreas","Kemper, Leon (Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry, University of Münster, Corrensstraße 48, 48149, Münster, Germany); Hensel, Andreas (Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry, University of Münster, Corrensstraße 48, 48149, Münster, Germany)","Hensel, Andreas (University of Münster)","Kemper, Leon (University of Münster); Hensel, Andreas (University of Münster)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00253-023-12456-w.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368064,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 3107 Microbiology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,

It extends previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses by (a) using a more balanced sample in terms of country composition, (b) considering new moderators (type of data and research design), and (c) including studies on tertiary education students in addition to primary and secondary education students. Our meta-analysis findings show that the pandemic had, on average, a detrimental effect on learning. The magnitude of this learning deficit (about 0.19 standard deviations of student achievement) appears to be roughly comparable to that suffered by students who have experienced a significant disruption in their schooling due to a major natural disaster (e.g., Hurricane Katrina). Students are also found to have lost more ground in math/science than in other subjects. Additionally, one year or more after the first lockdown, students seem to have been unable to catch up on unfinished learning from the pandemic. This result suggests that more efforts should be made to ensure students recover their missed learning in order to avoid negative long-term consequences for them and society.",Declaration of competing interest No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author.,This work has not been supported by any grants.,Educational Research Review,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,2023-03,,,100530,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Di Pietro, Giorgio","Di Pietro, Giorgio (European Commission- Joint Research Centre, 1 , Edificio Expo, Calle Inca Garcilaso, 3, 41092, Seville, Spain; Institute of Labour Economics (IZA), Schaumburg-Lippe-Straße 5-9, 53113, Bonn, Germany)","Di Pietro, Giorgio (Joint Research Center; Institute for the Study of Labor)","Di Pietro, Giorgio (Joint Research Center; Institute for the Study of Labor)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.edurev.2023.100530,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368142,"39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy",4 Quality Education

Recent work has shown the gut microbiome is important in modulating mental and physical health through the gut-brain axis. Yet, its association with emotions and emotion regulation are understudied. Here we examined whether positive and negative emotions, as well as two emotion regulation strategies (i.e. cognitive reappraisal and suppression), were associated with the gut microbiome composition and functional pathways in healthy women.
METHODS: Participants were from the Mind-Body Study (N = 206, mean age = 61), a sub-study of the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. In 2013, participants completed measures of emotion-related factors. Two pairs of stool samples were collected, 6 months apart, 3 months after emotion-related factors measures were completed. Analyses examined associations of emotion-related factors with gut microbial diversity, overall microbiome structure, and specific species/pathways and adjusted for relevant covariates.
RESULTS: Alpha diversity was negatively associated with suppression. In multivariate analysis, positive emotions were inversely associated with the relative abundance of Firmicutes bacterium CAG 94 and Ruminococcaceae bacterium D16, while negative emotions were directly correlated with the relative abundance of these same species. At the metabolic pathway level, negative emotions were inversely related to the biosynthesis of pantothenate, coenzyme A, and adenosine.

A case study design was employed to track the identity negotiations of this European non-native Chinese speaker during 12 weeks of her first semester of teaching. Analysis of the data revealed nine subcategories within the psychological, behavioural, and relational domains according to the Identity Triangle Model. The findings suggest that this new non-native speaker teacher viewed her as an accidental teacher, exploring a teaching career without a strong instrumentalist aspiration or a clear career path in language teaching. Instead, she were more motivated by a desire for personal growth and the opportunity to reinvent themselves in a new cultural context. The results of this study offer theoretical implications for the adoption of a unified framework in future research on the identity of first-time language teachers, and practical implications for developing sustainable strategies aimed at recruiting and retaining non-native speaker teachers in foreign language education.","This publication was supported by the Marsden Fund Council from New Zealand Government funding, managed by Royal Society Te Apārangi.

500,pub.1156413061,10.1002/jad.12162,36945192,,Recall bias of students' affective experiences in adolescence: The role of personality and internalizing behavior,"INTRODUCTION: Adolescence is characterized by multiple biopsychosocial changes, associated with a high intraindividual variability of emotional experiences. Previous findings suggest that this intraindividual variability is reflected in a recall bias of adolescents' emotion reports. However, corresponding findings are scarce and inconclusive. Studies on predictors of recall bias in adulthood indicate that personality traits, especially neuroticism and extraversion, as well as specific internalizing disorders might affect recall bias of emotion reports.
METHODS: The sample consists of 118 Swiss adolescent students in grade 8 and 9 (Mage  = 15.15, SDage  = 0.89). The students' momentary affective experience was recorded using smartphones over seven consecutive days in situ at 42 randomly generated occasions (six per day), with a total of 1059 protocols on current events. At the end of the experience-sampling phase, students filled out an online questionnaire, providing information about their personality and typical behavior as well as their retrospective affective experience. In addition, the students' behavior was evaluated by their teachers. We applied two-level structural equation modeling with latent difference variables.
RESULTS: Adolescents high in extraversion showed retrospective overestimation of positive affective experiences and underestimation of negative affective experiences. Adolescents with high neuroticism tended to overestimate negative affect retrospectively, showing no significant effects for positive affect. However, internalizing behavior did not predict a negative recall bias in adolescents' affective experience.
CONCLUSIONS: Retrospective self-reports about adolescents' affective experience are biased by relatively stable individual factors, whereas less stable individual factors did not seem to have any influence.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This article is based on data from a project funded by the Swiss National Research Foundation (Grant 122274) and the University of Applied Sciences of Special Needs Education Zurich, Switzerland.

To reduce non-attendance rates, patient non-attendance fees have been introduced in various settings. Although some argue in narrow economic terms that behavioural change as a result of financial incentives is a voluntary transaction, charging patients for non-attendance remains controversial. This paper aims to investigate the controversies of implementing patient non-attendance fees.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to map out the arguments in the Norwegian public debate concerning the introduction and use of patient non-attendance fees at public outpatient clinics.
METHODS: Public consultation documents (2009-2021) were thematically analysed (n=84). We used a preconceived conceptual framework based on the works of Grant to guide the analysis.
RESULTS: A broad range of arguments for and against patient non-attendance fees were identified, here referring to the acceptability of the fees' purpose, the voluntariness of the responses, the effects on the individual character and institutional norms and the perceived fairness and comparative effectiveness of patient non-attendance fees. Whereas the aim of motivating patients to keep their appointments to avoid poor utilisation of resources and increased waiting times was widely supported, principled and practical arguments against patient non-attendance fees were raised.
CONCLUSION: A narrow economic understanding of incentives cannot capture the breadth of arguments for and against patient non-attendance fees. Policy makers may draw on this insight when implementing similar incentive schemes.

Herein, we demonstrate the tunability of this separation with peroxide species formed by excessively adsorbed oxygen, thereby modifying the catalytic activity and selectivity of the oxide. Using CuO as an example, we show that a surface layer of peroxide species acts as a promotor to significantly enhance CuO reducibility in favor of H2 oxidation but conversely as an inhibitor to suppress CuO reduction against CO oxidation. Together with atomistic modeling, we identify that this opposite effect of the peroxide on the two oxidation reactions stems from its modification on coordinately unsaturated sites of the oxide surface. By differentiating the chemical functionality between lattice oxygen and peroxide, these results are closely relevant to a wide range of catalytic oxidation reactions using excessively adsorbed oxygen to activate lattice oxygen and tune the activity and selectivity of redox sites.","This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering under Award No. DE-SC0001135.

Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in diabetic complications. However, the regulation of mitochondria function in the diabetic cornea and its impacts on wound healing remain elusive. The present study aimed to explore the molecular basis for the disturbed mitochondrial metabolism and subsequent wound healing impairment in the diabetic cornea. Seahorse analysis showed that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is a major source of ATP production in human corneal epithelial cells. Live corneal biopsy punches from type 1 and type 2 diabetic mouse models showed impaired mitochondrial functions, correlating with impaired corneal wound healing, compared to nondiabetic controls. To approach the molecular basis for the impaired mitochondrial function, we found that Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-α (PPARα) expression was downregulated in diabetic human corneas. Even without diabetes, global PPARα knockout mice and corneal epithelium-specific PPARα conditional knockout mice showed disturbed mitochondrial function and delayed wound healing in the cornea, similar to that in diabetic corneas. In contrast, fenofibrate, a PPARα agonist, ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced wound healing in the corneas of diabetic mice. Similarly, corneal epithelium-specific PPARα transgenic overexpression improved mitochondrial function and enhanced wound healing in the cornea. Furthermore, PPARα agonist ameliorated the mitochondrial dysfunction in primary human corneal epithelial cells exposed to diabetic stressors, which was impeded by siRNA knockdown of PPARα, suggesting a PPARα-dependent mechanism. These findings suggest that downregulation of PPARα plays an important role in the impaired mitochondrial function in the corneal epithelium and delayed corneal wound healing in diabetes.","This study was supported by NIH grants (EY019309, EY012231, EY028949, EY028773, EY033330, EY032930, EY032931, and EY033477).",,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,2023-03-28,120,13,e2217576120,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Liang, Wentao; Huang, Li; Whelchel, Amy; Yuan, Tian; Ma, Xiang; Cheng, Rui; Takahashi, Yusuke; Karamichos, Dimitrios; Ma, Jian-Xing","Liang, Wentao (Department of Physiology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104; Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157); Huang, Li (Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157; Department of Ophthalmology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, 350000, China); Whelchel, Amy (Department of Physiology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104); Yuan, Tian (Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157); Ma, Xiang (Department of Physiology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104; Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157); Cheng, Rui (Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157); Takahashi, Yusuke (Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157); Karamichos, Dimitrios (Division of Research and Innovation, North Texas Eye Research Institute, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, 76107; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, 76107; Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, 76107); Ma, Jian-Xing (Department of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157)","Karamichos, Dimitrios (University of North Texas Health Science Center; University of North Texas Health Science Center; University of North Texas Health Science Center); Ma, Jian-Xing (Wake Forest University)","Liang, Wentao (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center; Wake Forest University); Huang, Li (Wake Forest University; Union Hospital); Whelchel, Amy (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center); Yuan, Tian (Wake Forest University); Ma, Xiang (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center; Wake Forest University); Cheng, Rui (Wake Forest University); Takahashi, Yusuke (Wake Forest University); Karamichos, Dimitrios (University of North Texas Health Science Center; University of North Texas Health Science Center; University of North Texas Health Science Center); Ma, Jian-Xing (Wake Forest University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2217576120,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156376743,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,

Although the paper will touch Bernard’s experimental intuitions and his experimental practice as well, its focus is slightly different. It will address the laboratory, that is, the space in which experimentation in the life sciences takes place, and it will analyze the scattered remarks that Bernard made on the topic both in his books and in his posthumously published writings. The paper is divided into four parts. The introduction briefly sketches the coming into being of the physiological laboratory in the first half of the nineteenth century. The second section will give an overview of Claude Bernard’s own itinerary in physiology and his personal laboratory experience. The third part of the paper will have a look at the image of the laboratory that Claude depicted in his Introduction to Experimental Medicine. In the subsequent section and by contrast, the image of the laboratory will come into focus as it can be reconstructed from Bernard’s notebook that he kept between 1850 and 1860, the Cahier rouge. Finally, the fifth part of the paper will spotlight Claude Bernard’s comparison of the sciences and the arts and their respective practices.

There is a need to understand how to disseminate guidelines in this setting as dissemination is a prerequisite of adoption and implementation. This randomized controlled trial explored the impact of a video-based strategy to disseminate guidelines on family day care educators' intentions to adopt outdoor free play guidelines. Educators (N = 255) were randomized to receive a video (intervention) or text-based (usual care) resource via email describing recommendations. Educators were invited to participate in a post-intervention survey at 5-week follow-up assessing intentions to adopt guidelines. The secondary outcomes included knowledge, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, social/professional role and identity, goals, implementation of guidelines, acceptability of resource and intervention reach. There was no statistically significant difference between groups in intentions to adopt guidelines [ß = 0.01 (95% confidence interval -0.50 to 0.52), P = 0.97], nor for any secondary outcomes. Further investigation is needed to identify effective dissemination strategies in the family day care setting to increase the adoption of public health guidelines.",,,Health Education Research,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,2023-03-21,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Lum, M; Yoong, S L; Wolfenden, L; Turon, H; Reilly, K; Grady, A","Lum, M (Hunter New England Population Health, Hunter New England Local Health District, Booth Building, Longworth Ave, Wallsend, NSW 2287, Australia.; School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, University Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.; Hunter Medical Research Institute, University of Newcastle, Lot 1 Kookaburra Cct, New Lambton Heights, NSW 2305, Australia.; Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, University of Newcastle, University Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.); Yoong, S L (Hunter New England Population Health, Hunter New England Local Health District, Booth Building, Longworth Ave, Wallsend, NSW 2287, Australia.; School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, University Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.; Hunter Medical Research Institute, University of Newcastle, Lot 1 Kookaburra Cct, New Lambton Heights, NSW 2305, Australia.; Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, University of Newcastle, University Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.; Global Centre for Preventive Nutrition and Health, Institute for Health Transformation, School of Health and Social Development, Deakin University, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, VIC 3125, Australia.); Wolfenden, L (Hunter New England Population Health, Hunter New England Local Health District, Booth Building, Longworth Ave, Wallsend, NSW 2287, Australia.; School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, University Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.; Hunter Medical Research Institute, University of Newcastle, Lot 1 Kookaburra Cct, New Lambton Heights, NSW 2305, Australia.; Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, University of Newcastle, University Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.); Turon, H (School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, University Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.; Hunter Medical Research Institute, University of Newcastle, Lot 1 Kookaburra Cct, New Lambton Heights, NSW 2305, Australia.; Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, University of Newcastle, University Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.); Reilly, K (School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, University Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.; Hunter Medical Research Institute, University of Newcastle, Lot 1 Kookaburra Cct, New Lambton Heights, NSW 2305, Australia.; Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, University of Newcastle, University Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.); Grady, A (Hunter New England Population Health, Hunter New England Local Health District, Booth Building, Longworth Ave, Wallsend, NSW 2287, Australia.; School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, University Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.; Hunter Medical Research Institute, University of Newcastle, Lot 1 Kookaburra Cct, New Lambton Heights, NSW 2305, Australia.; Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, University of Newcastle, University Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.)",,"Lum, M (Hunter New England Local Health District; University of Newcastle Australia; University of Newcastle Australia; University of Newcastle Australia); Yoong, S L (Hunter New England Local Health District; University of Newcastle Australia; University of Newcastle Australia; University of Newcastle Australia; Deakin University); Wolfenden, L (Hunter New England Local Health District; University of Newcastle Australia; University of Newcastle Australia; University of Newcastle Australia); Turon, H (University of Newcastle Australia; University of Newcastle Australia; University of Newcastle Australia); Reilly, K (University of Newcastle Australia; University of Newcastle Australia; University of Newcastle Australia); Grady, A (Hunter New England Local Health District; University of Newcastle Australia; University of Newcastle Australia; University of Newcastle Australia)",0,0,,,https://academic.oup.com/her/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/her/cyad014/49584050/cyad014.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156376366,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being; 4 Quality Education

We performed spatial analysis to identify geographic clusters and factors associated with mortality in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We utilized Sizanani trial (NCT01188941) data, which enrolled participants August 2010-January 2013 and obtained vital status at 5.8 (IQR 5.0-6.4) years of follow-up. We mapped geocoded addresses to 2011 Census-defined small area layer (SAL) centroids, used Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic to identify mortality clusters, and compared socio-demographic factors for SALs within and outside mortality clusters. We assigned 1,143 participants living with HIV (260 [23%] of whom died during follow-up) to 677 SALs. One lower mortality cluster (n = 90, RR = 0.23, p = 0.022) was identified near a hospital outside Durban. SALs in the cluster were younger (24y vs 25y, p < 0.001); had fewer bedrooms/household (3 vs 4, p < 0.001); had more females (52% vs 51%, p = 0.013) and residents with no schooling past age 20 (4% vs 3%, p < 0.001) or no education at all (4% vs 3%, p < 0.001); had fewer residents with income >3,200 ZAR/month (5% vs 9%, p < 0.001); and had reduced access to piped water (p < 0.001), refuse disposal (p < 0.001), and toilets (p < 0.001).

However, few studies to date have tested whether early brain measures are indicative of the developmental trajectory of language, as opposed to language outcomes at specific ages. We combined recordings from two longitudinal studies, including typically developing infants without a family history of autism, and infants with increased likelihood of developing autism (infant-siblings) (N = 191). Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded at 6 months, and behavioral assessments at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months of age. Using a growth curve model, we tested whether absolute EEG spectral power at 6 months was associated with concurrent language abilities, and developmental change in language between 6 and 36 months. We found evidence of an association between 6-month alpha-band power and concurrent, but not developmental change in, expressive language ability in both infant-siblings and control infants. The observed association between 6-month alpha-band power and 6-month expressive language was not moderated by group status, suggesting some continuity in neural mechanisms.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS A special thanks to all of the families and their infants who participated in research related to identifying risk for ASD across contributing sites as well as the teams that generated the rich data reported in the current manuscript.

However, previous studies did not examine the predictive utility of D/S-IAT on short-term suicide risk trajectories among adolescents, especially during the critical period following discharge from the emergency room (ER) due to suicide behaviors.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined the ability of the D/S-IAT to discriminate and predict suicide risk trajectories during the month following initial suicide risk assessment, among adolescents recently discharged from the ER.
METHODS: One hundred and fifteen adolescents aged 9-18 years (77.4% female) were assessed at clinic intake. All participants completed D/S-IAT and self-report measures for suicide risk, depression, and anxiety during intake and 1-month follow-up.
RESULTS: The D/S-IAT distinguished and predicted participants with continued heightened suicide risk at follow-up, above and beyond depression, anxiety, and suicide risk level at intake.

Research has linked quality in the coparenting relationship to several child outcomes as well as parent relationship satisfaction and mental health, yet whether and how these links may differ depending on child age is unclear. Here, we investigated links between coparenting quality, relationship satisfaction, parents' education, and child age, after assessing the psychometric properties of a Swedish version of the 35-item Coparenting Relationship Scale (CRS) in a sample of 206 parents in Sweden. Participants completed the full 35-item CRS, alongside the Parenting Alliance Measure (PAM) and a relationship satisfaction measure. Our findings reveal good psychometric qualities and construct validity for both the CRS and PAM used with Swedish parents. Consistent with other adaptations of the CRS, we found four composite factors for the CRS, all demonstrating high reliability and convergence with the PAM. In relation to child age, parents of older children reported poorer coparenting quality than parents of younger children. The link between relationship satisfaction and coparenting quality was stronger for highly educated parents. Education also predicted partner endorsement in parents of children in early and middle childhood, but not parents of infants. Together, our findings expand the empirical base for understanding coparenting and its links to relationship satisfaction in parents with children of different ages, and they highlight a moderating role of parental education in these links.",Conflicts of interest The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.,"Funding information The study was partly funded by the Swedish Research Council (2019‐02787) and the Crafoord Foundation (2019‐1024), both awarded to Elia Psouni.

This may require high doses of norepinephrine, which has been associated with severe end organ damage. With this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of norepinephrine on the incidence of DCI in a clinical setting.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective evaluation of patients with aSAH admitted to our institution between November 2018 and March 2021. Potential risk factors for DCI were analyzed and significant predictors were assessed by means of a logistic regression analysis to account for potential confounders.
RESULTS: In this study, 104 patients were included. Hereof, 39 (38%) showed radiologic signs of DCI between day three and 14 post-intervention. These patients had more frequent vasospasms (n = 37 vs. 30, p = 0.022), a higher Hunt & Hess score (3 ± 2 vs. 2 ± 1, p = 0.004), a lower initial Glasgow Coma Scale score (9 ± 5 vs. 12 ± 4, p = 0.003) and received a higher median norepinephrine dose (20,356μg vs. 6,508μg, p < 0.001). A logistic regression analysis revealed that only high-dose norepinephrine administration (OR 2.84, CI 1.56-7.8) and vasospasm (OR 3.07, CI 1.2-7.84) appeared to be significant independent risk factors for DCI.

This research identifies indicators of value and relevance taken from the twenty-first century competences literature, then measures their presence in four different Industrial Design education settings. Two studies were undertaken. First, Industrial Design educators from primary, secondary, and tertiary levels were surveyed. Then diverse Industrial Design education stakeholders from education and non-education settings were interviewed. The studies gathered both quantitative and qualitative data on the value and relevance of current Industrial Design education in Australia.

However, its association with metrics of research dissemination has not been adequately investigated, particularly in the field of medical research. The aim of this study was to assess the association between video abstracts and citations, views and Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) of research papers. A cross-sectional study of research reports published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) over a 3-year period was conducted. An inverse binomial regression was used to assess factors associated with citations, views and AAS. The model included the presence of video abstracts as well as other independent covariables as potential confounding factors. 500 research reports were included in the analysis and 152 benefited from a video abstract. The median time from publication was 3.0 (2.2 to 3.6) years and 72% were RCTs. Research reports published with a video abstract were associated with an increase in citations (IRR 1.15), although this estimate came with uncertainty ranging from virtually no effect to a worthwhile effect (95% CI 0.98 to 1.35). There were also associated with a worthwhile increase in views (IRR 1.35, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.54) as well as with an increase in AAS (IRR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44).

However, little is known about whether the features and dynamics of linguistic positivity vary across disciplines. In addition, the relationship between linguistic positivity and research impact deserves further evaluation. To address these issues, the present study investigated linguistic positivity in academic writing from a cross-disciplinary perspective. Based on a 111-million-word corpus of research article abstracts collected from the Web of Science, the study examined the diachronic trends of positive/negative language in eight academic disciplines, and explored the relationship between linguistic positivity and citation counts. The results demonstrated that the increase in linguistic positivity is a common phenomenon across the examined academic disciplines. In addition, hard disciplines showed a higher and faster-growing degree of linguistic positivity compared with soft disciplines. Last, a significant positive correlation was identified between citation counts and the degree of linguistic positivity. Reasons for the temporal dynamics and disciplinary variation of linguistic positivity were explored, and implications for the scientific community were discussed.",,"This study was supported by Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation, Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China (Grant No. 21YJC740085).",Scientometrics,,,2023-03-21,2023,2023-03-21,,,,1-21,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Liu, Xueying; Zhu, Haoran","Liu, Xueying (Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1037 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, China); Zhu, Haoran (Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1037 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, China)","Zhu, Haoran (Huazhong University of Science and Technology)","Liu, Xueying (Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Zhu, Haoran (Huazhong University of Science and Technology)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11192-023-04679-5.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156368236,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

Old agents become poorer from unexpected longevity gains than from expected gains, as they cannot prepare (save) for the former in advance. In an overlapping-generations model with means-tested pay-as-you-go social security, we show that young agents reduce their fertility when longevity increases because they need to save more for their old age (“life-cycle effect”), and in the unexpected case, they also need to pay taxes to support the impoverished elderly (“policy effect”). Using cross-country panel data on mortality rates and social expenditure, we find that an unexpected increase in life expectancy at age 65 lowers total fertility rate growth and government family-related spending growth while raising government old-age spending growth.","We thank Raj Chetty, Dirk Krueger, Christine Ho, Joon Young Hur, Jungmin Lee, Hsien-Mien Lien, Dae-il Kim, Jinyoung Kim, Taehoon Kim, Chulhee Lee, Sam-Ho Lee, Minkee Song, Jessie Wang, editor Gregory Ponthiere, two anonymous referees, and seminar participants at the 2019 AASLE annual conference, 2019 WEAI annual conference, and Seoul National University for helpful comments.

However, few longitudinal studies identify the characteristics of young adults who track their behavior, findings that could be useful in designing tracking-related interventions. Our objective was to identify predictors of past-year food and PA tracking among young adults.
METHODS: Data were available for 676 young adults participating in the ongoing longitudinal Nicotine Dependence in Teens Study. Potential predictors were measured in 2017-2020 at age 31, and past-year food and PA tracking were measured in 2021-2022 at age 34. Each potential predictor was studied in a separate multivariable logistic regression model controlling for age, sex, and educational attainment.
RESULTS: One third (37%) of participants reported past-year PA tracking; 14% reported past-year food, and 10% reported both. Nine and 11 of 41 potential predictors were associated with food and PA tracking, respectively. Compensatory behaviors after overeating, trying to lose weight, self-report overweight, reporting a wide variety of exercise behaviors, and pressure to lose weight predicted both food and PA tracking.
CONCLUSION: Food and PA tracking are relatively common among young adults. If the associations observed herein between compensatory behavior after overeating and tracking (among other observed associations) are replicated and found to be causal, caution may need to be exercised in making ""blanket"" recommendations to track food intake and/or PA to all young adults seeking behavior change.",,,Health Education & Behavior,,,2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,2023-03-20,,,10901981231159679,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"O'Loughlin, Erin K; Marashi, Maryam; Sabiston, Catherine M; Lucibello, Kristen M; Sylvestre, Marie-Pierre; O'Loughlin, Jennifer L","O'Loughlin, Erin K (Centre de recherche du centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.); Marashi, Maryam (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.); Sabiston, Catherine M (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.); Lucibello, Kristen M (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.); Sylvestre, Marie-Pierre (Centre de recherche du centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.); O'Loughlin, Jennifer L (Centre de recherche du centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Université de Montréal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.)",,"O'Loughlin, Erin K (Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal; University of Toronto); Marashi, Maryam (University of Toronto); Sabiston, Catherine M (University of Toronto); Lucibello, Kristen M (University of Toronto); Sylvestre, Marie-Pierre (Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal; University of Montreal); O'Loughlin, Jennifer L (Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal; University of Montreal)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/10901981231159679,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156375871,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,

This article explores how the twink has come to bear connotations of effeminacy and bottom subjectivity, highlighting the steady erosion of other available cultural terms to denote a bottom whose gender expression does not conform to dominant cultural masculine stereotypes. It offers an analysis of two key historical effeminate bottom identities in Britain and the US, the ""fairy"" and ""queen,"" and argues that the twink not only now carries connotations originally attached to these historical identities, but that it merges their gendered and sexual connotations with new characteristics concerning age and body type that may cause considerable anxiety among contemporary gay men due to their unsustainable ""shelf life.""",This paper was written while the author was employed as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Wellcome Centre for Cultures and Environments of Health (University of Exeter).,The work was supported by the Wellcome Trust,Journal of Homosexuality,,,2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,2023-03-20,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-21,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Vytniorgu, Richard","Vytniorgu, Richard (Wellcome Centre for Cultures and Environments of Health, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK)","Vytniorgu, Richard (Wellcome Centre of Cultures and Environments of Health)","Vytniorgu, Richard (Wellcome Centre of Cultures and Environments of Health)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2023.2186760,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156340070,44 Human Society; 4405 Gender Studies,

One such aspect is editorial board composition, which has been shown to exhibit racial and geographical disparities. However, the literature on this subject lacks longitudinal studies quantifying the degree to which the racial composition of editors reflects that of scientists. Other aspects that may exhibit racial disparities include the time spent between the submission and acceptance of a manuscript and the number of citations a paper receives relative to textually similar papers, but these have not been studied to date. To fill this gap, we compile a dataset of 1,000,000 papers published between 2001 and 2020 by six publishers, while identifying the handling editor of each paper. Using this dataset, we show that most countries in Asia, Africa, and South America (where the majority of the population is ethnically non-White) have fewer editors than would be expected based on their share of authorship. Focusing on US-based scientists reveals Black as the most underrepresented race. In terms of acceptance delay, we find, again, that papers from Asia, Africa, and South America spend more time compared to other papers published in the same journal and the same year. Regression analysis of US-based papers reveals that Black authors suffer from the greatest delay. Finally, by analyzing citation rates of US-based papers, we find that Black and Hispanic scientists receive significantly fewer citations compared to White ones doing similar research.

However, these attempts to foster SRL are not always successful. Evidence: We considered complexities related to fostering self-regulated learning by use of an analogy. This analogy was based on two (Dutch) children's games: the treasure hunt (children can find a ""treasure"" by following directions, completing assignments and/or answering questions) and the dropping (pre-teens are dropped in the woods at nighttime with the assignment to find their way back home). We formulated four interrelated philosophical questions. These questions were not formulated with the intention to provide clear-cut answers, but were instead meant to evoke contemplation about the SRL concept. During this contemplation, the implications of definitional issues regarding SRL were discussed by use of the first question: What are the consequences of the difficulties to explicate what is (not) SRL? The second question (How does SRL relate to autonomy?) touched upon the intricate relationship between SRL and autonomy, by discussing the role of social interaction and varying degrees of instruction when fostering SRL. Next, a related topic was addressed by the third question: How much risk are we willing and able to take when fostering SRL? And finally, the importance of and possibilities to assess SRL were discussed by the fourth question (Should SRL be assessed?). Implications: From our contemplations it has become clear that approaches to foster SRL are often insufficiently aligned with the experience and needs of learners. Instead these approaches are commonly defined by contextual factors, such as misconceptions about SRL and lack of leeway for learners. Consequently, we have used principles that apply to both treasure hunts and droppings, to provide guidelines on how to align one's approach to foster SRL with the educational context and experience and needs of learners.",The authors would like to thank Pepijn van der Gulden for his constructive feedback on different versions of this manuscript.

This is an example of associative learning, a process in which behavior is modified by making associations between various stimuli. Since the mathematical theory of conditioning does not account for some of its salient aspects, such as spontaneous recovery of extinguished associations, accurate modeling of behavior of real animals during conditioning has turned out difficult. Here, we do this in the context of the dynamics of the thermal preference of C. elegans. We quantify C. elegans thermotaxis in response to various conditioning temperatures, starvation durations, and genetic perturbations using a high-resolution microfluidic droplet assay. We model these data comprehensively, within a biologically interpretable, multi-modal framework. We find that the strength of the thermal preference is composed of two independent, genetically separable contributions and requires a model with at least four dynamical variables. One pathway positively associates the experienced temperature independently of food and the other negatively associates with the temperature when food is absent. The multidimensional structure of the association strength provides an explanation for the apparent classical temperature-food association of C. elegans thermal preference and a number of longstanding questions in animal learning, including spontaneous recovery, asymmetric response to appetitive vs. aversive cues, latent inhibition, and generalization among similar cues.","We acknowledge the support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) (W.S.R.), Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) Grant No. RGY0084/2011 (W.S.R. and I.N.), US NSF Grants No. 1208126 and 1822677 (A.R. and I.N.) and the Simons Foundation Investigator Program (I.N.).

Our primary question was why do some students learn faster than others? Or, do they? We model data from student performance on groups of tasks that assess the same skill component and that provide follow-up instruction on student errors. Our models estimate, for both students and skills, initial correctness and learning rate, that is, the increase in correctness after each practice opportunity. We applied our models to 1.3 million observations across 27 datasets of student interactions with online practice systems in the context of elementary to college courses in math, science, and language. Despite the availability of up-front verbal instruction, like lectures and readings, students demonstrate modest initial prepractice performance, at about 65% accuracy. Despite being in the same course, students' initial performance varies substantially from about 55% correct for those in the lower half to 75% for those in the upper half. In contrast, and much to our surprise, we found students to be astonishingly similar in estimated learning rate, typically increasing by about 0.1 log odds or 2.5% in accuracy per opportunity. These findings pose a challenge for theories of learning to explain the odd combination of large variation in student initial performance and striking regularity in student learning rate.","We thank Carnegie Learning, Inc., for making available a number of the datasets used in this study and the National Science Foundation for support in creating the data infrastructure and performing the research including grants from Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE 0354420 and SBE 0836012), from Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC 1443068) and from Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS 1824257).",,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,2023-03-28,120,13,e2221311120,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Koedinger, Kenneth R.; Carvalho, Paulo F.; Liu, Ran; McLaughlin, Elizabeth A.","Koedinger, Kenneth R.

This core oscillator can be reconstituted in vitro and is used to study the molecular mechanisms of circadian timekeeping and entrainment. Previous studies showed that two key metabolic changes that occur in cells during the transition into darkness, changes in the ATP/ADP ratio and redox status of the quinone pool, are cues that entrain the circadian clock. By changing the ATP/ADP ratio or adding oxidized quinone, one can shift the phase of the phosphorylation cycle of the core oscillator in vitro. However, the in vitro oscillator cannot explain gene expression patterns because the simple mixture lacks the output components that connect the clock to genes. Recently, a high-throughput in vitro system termed the in vitro clock (IVC) that contains both the core oscillator and the output components was developed. Here, we used IVC reactions and performed massively parallel experiments to study entrainment, the synchronization of the clock with the environment, in the presence of output components. Our results indicate that the IVC better explains the in vivo clock-resetting phenotypes of wild-type and mutant strains and that the output components are deeply engaged with the core oscillator, affecting the way input signals entrain the core pacemaker. These findings blur the line between input and output pathways and support our previous demonstration that key output components are fundamental parts of the clock.",Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH under Award Numbers R35GM118290 to S.S.G. and R35GM144110 to A.L.,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,Circadian Clocks; Circadian Rhythm; Circadian Rhythm Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Bacterial Proteins; Synechococcus; Phosphorylation; Adenosine Triphosphate,2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,2023-03-28,120,13,e2221453120,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Fang, Mingxu; Chavan, Archana G.; LiWang, Andy; Golden, Susan S.","Fang, Mingxu (Center for Circadian Biology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093); Chavan, Archana G.

We investigate whether and to what extent close kin (i.e., partner and children) matter for older people in taking on precautionary behaviors (e.g., wearing a mask) and vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Drawing on data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we combine its Corona Surveys (June to September 2020 and June to August 2021) with pre-COVID information (October 2019 to March 2020). We find that having close kin (especially a partner) is associated with a higher probability of both adopting precautionary behaviors and accepting a COVID-19 vaccine. Results are robust to controlling for other potential drivers of precautionary behaviors and vaccine acceptance and to accounting for coresidence with kin. Our findings suggest that policymakers and practitioners may differently address kinless individuals when promoting public policy measures.","This paper uses data from SHARE Waves 8 and 9 (DOIs: 10.6103/SHARE.w8.800, 10.6103/SHARE.w8ca.800, 10.6103/SHARE.w9ca800), see Börsch-Supan et al.

500,pub.1156350161,10.1111/jcpp.13754,36940718,,Research Review: Viewing self‐harm images on the internet and social media platforms: systematic review of the impact and associated psychological mechanisms,"BACKGROUND: Viewing self-harm and suicide-related images online can precede these behaviours. We reviewed studies of potential impacts and mechanisms associated with viewing self-harm-related images on the internet and social media.
METHOD: CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, HMIC, MEDLINE, PsycArticles, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, Sociological Abstracts and Web of Science Core Collection databases were searched for relevant studies from inception to 22 January 2022. Inclusion criteria were English language, peer-reviewed, empirical studies with data related to impacts of viewing self-harm images or videos on the internet or social media. Quality and risk of bias were assessed using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tools. A narrative synthesis approach was used.
RESULTS: Of the 15 identified studies, all found harmful effects of viewing self-harm-related images online. These included escalation of self-harm, reinforcement of engagement behaviours (e.g. commenting and sharing images), encouragement of social comparison (comparing own self-harm with others), development of a self-harm identity, social connection perpetuating or escalating self-harm, and emotional, cognitive, and physiological impacts triggering self-harm urges and acts. Nine studies found protective effects, including self-harm mitigation or reduction, promotion of self-harm recovery, encouraging social connection and help-giving, and emotional, cognitive and physiological impacts mitigating or reducing self-harm urges and acts. Causality of impact was not determined in any study. Most of the studies did not explicitly evaluate or discuss potential mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Viewing self-harm images online may have both harmful and protective effects, but harmful effects predominated in the studies. Clinically, it is important to assess individual's access to images relating to self-harm and suicide, and the associated impacts, alongside pre-existing vulnerabilities and contextual factors. Higher quality longitudinal research with less reliance on retrospective self-report is needed, as well as studies that test potential mechanisms. We have developed a conceptual model of the impact of viewing self-harm images online to inform future research.","Acknowledgements Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust funded K.S. to undertake this research as part of her Doctorate in Clinical Psychology at the Oxford Institute for Clinical Psychology Training and Research.

The abiotic origin of ROS on the Archean Earth has been heavily studied, and ROS are conventionally thought to have originated from H2O/CO2 dissociation. Here, we report experiments that lead to a mineral-based source of oxygen, rather than water alone. The mechanism involves ROS generation at abraded mineral-water interfaces in various geodynamic processes (e.g., water currents and earthquakes) which are active where free electrons are created via open-shell electrons and point defects, high pressure, water/ice interactions, and combinations of these processes. The experiments reported here show that quartz or silicate minerals may produce reactive oxygen-containing sites (≡SiO•, ≡SiOO•) that initially emerge in cleaving Si-O bonds in silicates and generate ROS during contact with water. Experimental isotope-labeling experiments show that the hydroxylation of the peroxy radical (≡SiOO•) is the predominant pathway for H2O2 generation. This heterogeneous ROS production chemistry allows the transfer of oxygen atoms between water and rocks and alters their isotopic compositions. This process may be pervasive in the natural environment, and mineral-based production of H2O2 and accompanying O2 could occur on Earth and potentially on other terrestrial planets, providing initial oxidants and free oxygen, and be a component in the evolution of life and planetary habitability.","We thank Jiazhuo He, Juan Fu, and Luhua Xie for help in sample analyses.

Here, we demonstrate that MB can be engineered to be nonspherical, endowing them with unique features for biomedical applications. Anisotropic MB were generated via one-dimensionally stretching spherical poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) MB above their glass transition temperature. Compared to their spherical counterparts, nonspherical polymeric MB displayed superior performance in multiple ways, including i) increased margination behavior in blood vessel-like flow chambers, ii) reduced macrophage uptake in vitro, iii) prolonged circulation time in vivo, and iv) enhanced blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation in vivo upon combination with transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS). Our studies identify shape as a design parameter in the MB landscape, and they provide a rational and robust framework for further exploring the application of anisotropic MB for ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery and imaging applications.","T.L. acknowledges support by the European Commission (EuroNanoMed-III: NSC4DIPG), the European Research Council (ERC-CoG 864121: Meta-Targeting), and the German Research Foundation [Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft: GRK/RTG2375 (grant #331065168) and SFB 1066].

Inhibition of the glucocorticoid-activating enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) reduces tissue-specific glucocorticoid action and promotes angiogenesis in murine models of myocardial infarction. Angiogenesis is important in the growth of some solid tumours. This study used murine models of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to test the hypothesis that 11β-HSD1 inhibition promotes angiogenesis and subsequent tumour growth. SCC or PDAC cells were injected into female FVB/N or C57BL6/J mice fed either standard diet, or diet containing the 11β-HSD1 inhibitor UE2316. SCC tumours grew more rapidly in UE2316-treated mice, reaching a larger (P<0.01) final volume (0.158 ± 0.037 cm3) than in control mice (0.051 ± 0.007 cm3). However, PDAC tumour growth was unaffected. Immunofluorescent analysis of SCC tumours did not show differences in vessel density (CD31/alpha-smooth muscle actin) or cell proliferation (Ki67) after 11β-HSD1 inhibition, and immunohistochemistry of SCC tumours did not show changes in inflammatory cell (CD3- or F4/80-positive) infiltration. In culture, the growth/viability (assessed by live cell imaging) of SCC cells was not affected by UE2316 or corticosterone. Second Harmonic Generation microscopy showed that UE2316 reduced Type I collagen (P<0.001), whilst RNA-sequencing revealed that multiple factors involved in the innate immune/inflammatory response were reduced in UE2316-treated SCC tumours. 11β-HSD1 inhibition increases SCC tumour growth, likely via suppression of inflammatory/immune cell signalling and extracellular matrix deposition, but does not promote tumour angiogenesis or growth of all solid tumours.",The authors are grateful to Marisa Magennis for administrative support.,"CT Davidson was funded by a British Heart Foundation studentship (Award Number: FS/13/52/30637).

Here, we characterize the effect of bortezomib treatment on primary and secondary lymphoid tissues in mice. We find that bortezomib stabilizes p53 in significant fractions of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow, including common lymphoid and myeloid progenitors, granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and dendritic cell progenitors. The stabilization of p53 is also observed in multipotent progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells, albeit at lower frequencies. In the thymus, bortezomib stabilizes p53 in CD4-CD8- T cells. Although there is less p53 stabilization in secondary lymphoid organs, cells in the germinal center of the spleen and Peyer's patch accumulate p53 in response to bortezomib. Bortezomib induces the upregulation of p53 target genes and p53 dependent/independent apoptosis in the bone marrow and thymus, suggesting that cells in these organs are robustly affected by proteasome inhibition. Comparative analysis of cell percentages in the bone marrow indicates expanded stem and multipotent progenitor pools in p53R172H mutant mice compared with p53 wild-type mice, suggesting a critical role for p53 in regulating the development and maturation of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. We propose that progenitors along the hematopoietic differentiation pathway express relatively high levels of p53 protein, which under steady-state conditions is constantly degraded by Mdm2 E3 ligase; however, these cells rapidly respond to stress to regulate stem cell renewal and consequently maintain the genomic integrity of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell populations.","We thank Ashok Venkitaraman and his team, He Ping Ping, and Teena Thakur in Disease Intervention Technology Lab for resource and technical support.

We show that one of these mutations, N969K induces a substantial displacement in the structure of the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) backbone in the HR1HR2 postfusion bundle. Due to this mutation, fusion-entry peptide inhibitors based on the Wuhan strain sequence are less efficacious. Here, we report an Omicron-specific peptide inhibitor designed based on the structure of the Omicron HR1HR2 postfusion bundle. Specifically, we inserted an additional residue in HR2 near the Omicron HR1 K969 residue to better accommodate the N969K mutation and relieve the distortion in the structure of the HR1HR2 postfusion bundle it introduced. The designed inhibitor recovers the loss of inhibition activity of the original longHR2_42 peptide with the Wuhan strain sequence against the Omicron variant in both a cell-cell fusion assay and a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-SARS-CoV-2 chimera infection assay, suggesting that a similar approach could be used to combat future variants. From a mechanistic perspective, our work suggests the interactions in the extended region of HR2 may mediate the initial landing of HR2 onto HR1 during the transition of the S protein from the prehairpin intermediate to the postfusion state.","We thank John Kuriyan, Subu Subramanian, Serena Muratcioglu, Timothy J.

This paper examines brain volume (BV) in middle and old age among two indigenous South American populations, the Tsimane and Moseten, whose lifestyles and environments diverge from those in high-income nations. With a sample of 1,165 individuals aged 40 to 94, we analyze population differences in cross-sectional rates of decline in BV with age. We also assess the relationships of BV with energy biomarkers and arterial disease and compare them against findings in industrialized contexts. The analyses test three hypotheses derived from an evolutionary model of brain health, which we call the embarrassment of riches (EOR). The model hypothesizes that food energy was positively associated with late life BV in the physically active, food-limited past, but excess body mass and adiposity are now associated with reduced BV in industrialized societies in middle and older ages. We find that the relationship of BV with both non-HDL cholesterol and body mass index is curvilinear, positive from the lowest values to 1.4 to 1.6 SDs above the mean, and negative from that value to the highest values. The more acculturated Moseten exhibit a steeper decrease in BV with age than Tsimane, but still shallower than US and European populations. Lastly, aortic arteriosclerosis is associated with lower BV. Complemented by findings from the United States and Europe, our results are consistent with the EOR model, with implications for interventions to improve brain health.","We thank the Tsimane and Moseten greatly for participating and Tsimane Health and Life History Project personnel for collecting and coding data.

Angiogenesis — the formation of new blood vessels — is highly active during brain development, enters almost complete quiescence in the healthy adult brain and is reactivated in vascular-dependent brain pathologies such as brain vascular malformations and brain tumours. Despite major advances in the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving angiogenesis in peripheral tissues, developmental signalling pathways orchestrating angiogenic processes in the healthy and the diseased CNS remain incompletely understood. Molecular signalling pathways of the ‘neurovascular link’ defining common mechanisms of nerve and vessel wiring have emerged as crucial regulators of peripheral vascular growth, but their relevance for angiogenesis in brain development and disease remains largely unexplored. Here we review the current knowledge of general and CNS-specific mechanisms of angiogenesis during brain development and in brain vascular malformations and brain tumours, including how key molecular signalling pathways are reactivated in vascular-dependent diseases. We also discuss how these topics can be studied in the single-cell multi-omics era.","The authors thank N. Chu Ji for help with the illustrations, P.

However, mortality is almost exclusively studied at local (within-population) scales creating a mismatch between our understanding of risk and the spatial extent most relevant to conservation and management of wide-ranging species. Here, we quantified mortality for 590 radio-collared mountain lions statewide across their distribution in California to identify drivers of human-caused mortality and investigate whether human-caused mortality is additive or compensatory. Human-caused mortality, primarily from conflict management and vehicles, exceeded natural mortality despite mountain lions being protected from hunting. Our data indicate that human-caused mortality is additive to natural mortality as population-level survival decreased as a function of increasing human-caused mortality and natural mortality did not decrease with increased human-caused mortality. Mortality risk increased for mountain lions closer to rural development and decreased in areas with higher proportions of citizens voting to support environmental initiatives. Thus, the presence of human infrastructure and variation in the mindset of humans sharing landscapes with mountain lions appear to be primary drivers of risk. We show that human-caused mortality can reduce population-level survival of large carnivores across large spatial scales, even when they are protected from hunting.","We thank M. Gabriel, P.

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are both required to develop disease, but their relative roles in initiating disease are unclear. To test whether CD4+ T cell infiltration into islets requires damage to β cells induced by autoreactive CD8+ T cells, we inactivated Wdfy4 in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice (NOD.Wdfy4-/--) using CRISPR/Cas9 targeting to eliminate cross-presentation by type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s). Similar to C57BL/6 Wdfy4-/- mice, cDC1 in NOD.Wdfy4-/- mice are unable to cross-present cell-associated antigens to prime CD8+ T cells, while cDC1 from heterozygous NOD.Wdfy4+/- mice cross-present normally. Further, NOD.Wdfy4-/- mice fail to develop diabetes while heterozygous NOD.Wdfy4+/- mice develop diabetes similarly to wild-type NOD mice. NOD.Wdfy4-/- mice remain capable of processing and presenting major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II)-restricted autoantigens and can activate β cell-specific CD4+ T cells in lymph nodes. However, disease in these mice does not progress beyond peri-islet inflammation. These results indicate that the priming of autoreactive CD8+ T cells in NOD mice requires cross-presentation by cDC1. Further, autoreactive CD8+ T cells appear to be required not only to develop diabetes, but to recruit autoreactive CD4+ T cells into islets of NOD mice, perhaps in response to progressive β cell damage.","This publication is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official view of the NIH.

Associative learning, the process through which organisms learn about the relationship between two distinct events, has been extensively studied in various animal taxa. However, the existence of associative learning, prior to the emergence of centralized nervous systems in bilaterian animals, remains unclear. Cnidarians such as sea anemones or jellyfish possess a nerve net, which lacks centralization. As the sister group to bilaterians, they are particularly well suited for studying the evolution of nervous system functions. Here, we probe the capacity of the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis to form associative memories by using a classical conditioning approach. We developed a protocol combining light as the conditioned stimulus with an electric shock as the aversive unconditioned stimulus. After repetitive training, animals exhibited a conditioned response to light alone-indicating that they learned the association. In contrast, all control conditions did not form associative memories. Besides shedding light on an aspect of cnidarian behavior, these results root associative learning before the emergence of NS centralization in the metazoan lineage and raise fundamental questions about the origin and evolution of cognition in brainless animals.",We thank Fabian Rentzsch for his feedback on earlier versions of this manuscript and the two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments that improved our work.

In a comprehensive, within-subjects, placebo-controlled design, we acquired multimodal neuroimaging [i.e., EEG-fMRI (electroencephalography-functional MRI)] data to assess the effects of intravenous (IV) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on brain function in 20 healthy volunteers. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was acquired prior to, during, and after a bolus IV administration of 20 mg DMT, and, separately, placebo. At dosages consistent with the present study, DMT, a serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist, induces a deeply immersive and radically altered state of consciousness. DMT is thus a useful research tool for probing the neural correlates of conscious experience. Here, fMRI results revealed robust increases in global functional connectivity (GFC), network disintegration and desegregation, and a compression of the principal cortical gradient under DMT. GFC × subjective intensity maps correlated with independent positron emission tomography (PET)-derived 5-HT2AR maps, and both overlapped with meta-analytical data implying human-specific psychological functions. Changes in major EEG-measured neurophysiological properties correlated with specific changes in various fMRI metrics, enriching our understanding of the neural basis of DMT's effects. The present findings advance on previous work by confirming a predominant action of DMT-and likely other 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics-on the brain's transmodal association pole, i.e., the neurodevelopmentally and evolutionarily recent cortex that is associated with species-specific psychological advancements, and high expression of 5-HT2A receptors.","This study was funded via a donation by Patrick Vernon.

First, the causes of 385 reported lifting injuries are divided into 36 independent causes at four levels through a systematic analysis approach, and the relationships among these causes are obtained through the Delphi method. Then, the accident causes are treated as nodes, and the relationships among the causes are used as edges to establish a network model of the causes of lifting accidents. The out-degree and in-degree topological potential of each node are calculated, and an importance ranking of lifting injuries causes is obtained. Finally, based on 11 evaluation indexes commonly used to assess node importance (node degree, betweenness centrality, etc.), the ability of the method proposed in this paper to effectively identify the key nodes in the cause network of lifting accidents is verified, and the conclusions can guide the safe implementation of lifting operations.",,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52179136), but the funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",PLOS ONE,,Lifting,2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,,18,3,e0283144,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yang, Yingliu; Jin, Lianghai","Yang, Yingliu (College of Hydraulic & Environmental Engineering, Three Gorges University, Yichang Hubei, China; Hubei Key Laboratory of Hydropower Engineering Construction and Management, Three Gorges University, Yichang Hubei, China); Jin, Lianghai (College of Hydraulic & Environmental Engineering, Three Gorges University, Yichang Hubei, China; Hubei Key Laboratory of Hydropower Engineering Construction and Management, Three Gorges University, Yichang Hubei, China; Safety & Environment Science and Technology Ltd, Yichang Hubei, China)","Jin, Lianghai (China Three Gorges University; China Three Gorges University; )","Yang, Yingliu (China Three Gorges University; China Three Gorges University); Jin, Lianghai (China Three Gorges University; China Three Gorges University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283144&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156335372,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations; 51 Physical Sciences",3 Good Health and Well Being

By constructing a two-period Malmquist-Luenberger index under the carbon emission constraint, we measure the AGTFP of cities in the YRD region from 2001 to 2019. Furthermore, adopting the Moran index method and the hot spot analysis method, this paper analyzes the global spatial correlation and local spatial correlation of AGTFP in this region. Moreover, we investigate its spatial convergence. The results show that the AGTFP of 41 cities in the YRD region is on an increasing trend; the growth of AGTFP in the eastern cities is mainly driven by green technical efficiency, while this growth in the southern cities is mainly stimulated by green technical efficiency and green technological progress. We also find a significant spatial correlation between cities' AGTFP in the YRD region from 2001 to 2019, but with certain fluctuations, showing a U-shaped trend of ""strong-weak-strong"". In addition, absolute β convergence of the AGTFP exists in the YRD region, and this convergence speed is accelerated with the addition of spatial factors. This evidence provides support for implementing the regional integration development strategy and optimizing the regional agricultural spatial layout. Our findings offer implications for promoting the transfer of green agricultural technology to the southwest of the YRD region, strengthening the construction of agricultural economic belts and agricultural economic circles, and improving the efficiency of agricultural resource use.",,"This research was funded by MOE (Ministry of Education of PRC) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences: 20YJC850001; Open Project of Key Laboratory of Ethnic Information E-commerce in Universities of Gansu Province (CN): 2020-2; the Introduction of Talent Research Program of Northwest Minzu University: xbmuyjrc202213; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Northwest Minzu University(CN): 31920220154; the National Natural Science Foundation of China: 72102216.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of the tumor microenvironment engage in crosstalk with cancer cells to mediate epigenetic control of gene expression. We identified CD90+ MSCs residing in the tumor microenvironment of patients with invasive breast cancer that exhibit a unique gene expression signature. Single-cell transcriptional analysis of these MSCs in tumor-associated stroma identified a distinct subpopulation characterized by increased expression of genes functionally related to extracellular matrix signaling. Blocking the TGFβ pathway reveals that these cells directly contribute to cancer cell proliferation.

There are 3 genera and 10 species of Myristicaceae present in China, mainly distributed in the south of Yunnan Province. Most research on this family focuses on fatty acids, medicine, and morphology. Based on the morphology, fatty acid chemotaxonomy, and a few of molecular data, the phylogenetic position of Horsfieldia pandurifolia Hu was controversial.
RESULTS: In this study, the chloroplast genomes of two Knema species, Knema globularia (Lam.) Warb. and Knema cinerea (Poir.) Warb., were characterized. Comparing the genome structure of these two species with those of other eight published species, including three Horsfieldia species, four Knema species, and one Myristica species, it was found that the chloroplast genomes of these species were relatively conserved, retaining the same gene order. Through sequence divergence analysis, there were 11 genes and 18 intergenic spacers were subject to positive selection, which can be used to analyze the population genetic structure of this family. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all Knema species were clustered in the same group and formed a sister clade with Myristica species support by both high maximum likelihood bootstrap values and Bayesian posterior probabilities; among Horsfieldia species, Horsfieldia amygdalina (Wall.) Warb., Horsfieldia kingii (Hook.f.) Warb., Horsfieldia hainanensis Merr. and Horsfieldia tetratepala C.Y.Wu. were grouped together, but H. pandurifolia formed a single group and formed a sister clade with genus Myristica and Knema. Through the phylogenetic analysis, we support de Wilde' view that the H. pandurifolia should be separated from Horsfieldia and placed in the genus Endocomia, namely Endocomia macrocoma subsp. prainii (King) W.J.de Wilde.

Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) has been used as the first-line treatment. However, evaluation of CBT conducted in a school setting has been scarce.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to review the CBT and its effectiveness in the school setting for children and adolescents with SAD or social anxiety symptoms. Quality assessment on individual studies was conducted.
METHODS: Studies were identified through the search in PsycINFO, ERIC, PubMed and Medline targeting CBT conducted in a school setting with an aim to treat children and adolescents with SAD or social anxiety symptoms. Randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies were selected.
RESULTS: A total of 7 studies met the inclusion criteria. Five studies were randomised controlled trials, and two were quasi-experimental studies with 2558 participants aged 6-16 years from 138 primary schools and 20 secondary schools. There were minor effects to reduce social anxiety symptoms for children and adolescents at post-intervention in 86% of the selected studies. Friend for Life (FRIENDS), Super Skills for Life (SSL) and Skills for Academic and Social Success (SASS) conducted in school were more effective than the control conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of quality of the evidence for FRIENDS, SSL and SASS, due to inconsistencies on the outcome assessments, statistical analyses, and the fidelity measures adopted in individual studies. Insufficient school funding and workforce with relevant health background, and the low level of parental involvement in the intervention would be the major challenges in school-based CBT for children and adolescents with SAD or social anxiety symptoms.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,"Humans; Child; Adolescent; Anxiety Disorders; Phobia, Social; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Schools; Anxiety; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,,18,3,e0283329,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tse, Zoie Wai Man; Emad, Shaista; Hasan, Kamrul; Papathanasiou, Ioanna V.; Rehman, Ibad ur; Lee, Ka Yiu","Tse, Zoie Wai Man (University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom); Emad, Shaista (Department of Biochemistry, Jinnah Medical & Dental College, Sohail University, Karachi, Pakistan); Hasan, Kamrul (Department of Public Health, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh); Papathanasiou, Ioanna V.

These features are expected to result in weak population structure. Here, we investigated population genetic structure of lumpfish throughout its natural distribution in the North Atlantic using two approaches: I) 4,393 genome wide SNPs and 95 individuals from 10 locations, and II) 139 discriminatory SNPs and 1,669 individuals from 40 locations. Both approaches identified extensive population genetic structuring with a major split between the East and West Atlantic and a distinct Baltic Sea population, as well as further differentiation of lumpfish from the English Channel, Iceland, and Greenland. The discriminatory loci displayed ~2-5 times higher divergence than the genome wide approach, revealing further evidence of local population substructures. Lumpfish from Isfjorden in Svalbard were highly distinct but resembled most fish from Greenland. The Kattegat area in the Baltic transition zone, formed a previously undescribed distinct genetic group. Also, further subdivision was detected within North America, Iceland, West Greenland, Barents Sea, and Norway. Although lumpfish have considerable potential for dispersal and gene-flow, the observed high levels of population structuring throughout the Atlantic suggests that this species may have a natal homing behavior and local populations with adaptive differences. This fine-scale population structure calls for consideration when defining management units for exploitation of lumpfish stocks and in decisions related to sourcing and moving lumpfish for cleaner fish use in salmonid aquaculture.","We are grateful to those many people who helped us acquiring and handling the samples used in this study: Eva Farestveit, Elizabeth A.

One way to study the relationship between current patents and their antecedents is by analyzing the similarity between the textual elements of patents. Many patent similarity indicators have shown a constant decrease since the mid-70s. Although several explanations have been proposed, more comprehensive analyses of this phenomenon have been rare. In this paper, we use a computationally efficient measure of patent similarity scores that leverages state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing tools, to investigate potential drivers of this apparent similarity decrease. This is achieved by modeling patent similarity scores by means of generalized additive models. We found that non-linear modeling specifications are able to distinguish between distinct, temporally varying drivers of the patent similarity levels that explain more variation in the data (R2 ∼ 18%) compared to previous methods.

People living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) have higher risk of suicidal behavior than the general population. The aim of this review is to summarize suicidal behavior, associated risk factors, and risk populations among PLHIV. Research studies in six databases from January 1, 1988, to July 8, 2021, were searched using keywords that included ""HIV,"" ""suicide,"" and ""risk factors."" The study design, suicide measurement techniques, risk factors, and study findings were extracted. A total of 193 studies were included. We found that the Americas, Europe, and Asia have the highest rates of suicidal behavior. Suicide risk factors include demographic factors, mental illness, and physiological, psychological, and social support. Depression is the most common risk factor for PLHIV, with suicidal ideation and attempt risk. Drug overdosage is the main cause of suicide death. In conclusion, the current study found that PLHIV had experienced a high level of suicidal status. This review provides an overview of suicidal behavior and its risk factors in PLHIV with the goal of better managing these factors and thus preventing death due to suicide.",The authors thank all the other authors of the included studies.,,PLOS ONE,,"Humans; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; HIV; Suicide; Risk Factors",2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,,18,3,e0269489,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tsai, Yi-Tseng; K M, Sriyani Padmalatha; Ku, Han-Chang; Wu, Yi-Lin; Ko, Nai-Ying","Tsai, Yi-Tseng (Department of Nursing, An Nan Hospital, China Medical University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Nursing, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.); K M, Sriyani Padmalatha (Department of Nursing, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Operating Room Department, National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, Sri Lanka.); Ku, Han-Chang (Department of Nursing, An Nan Hospital, China Medical University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Nursing, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.); Wu, Yi-Lin (Department of Nursing, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.); Ko, Nai-Ying (Department of Nursing, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.)",,"Tsai, Yi-Tseng (An-Nan Hospital; National Cheng Kung University); K M, Sriyani Padmalatha (National Cheng Kung University; National Hospital of Sri Lanka); Ku, Han-Chang (An-Nan Hospital; National Cheng Kung University); Wu, Yi-Lin (National Cheng Kung University); Ko, Nai-Ying (National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269489&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156340642,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Sodium nitroprusside is a nitric oxide (NO) donor and considered a promising new compound for the treatment of schizophrenia. New high-quality clinical trials of sodium nitroprusside in the treatment of schizophrenia have been published in recent years. It is necessary to re-conduct the meta-analysis after the inclusion of these new clinical trials. Our study will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature in this field, so as to lay an evidence-based medicine foundation for the efficacy of sodium nitroprusside in the treatment of schizophrenia.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of sodium nitroprusside in the treatment of schizophrenia were searched through English databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library) and Chinese databases (China Biology Medicine disc, VIP, WanFang Data, and CNKI). The extracted data will be inputted into Review Manager 5.3 for Meta-analysis. The included literature will be assessed for bias risk according to the bias risk assessment tools in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Funnel plots will be used to assess possible publication bias. Heterogeneity is tested by I2 and χ2 tests, and the existence of heterogeneity is defined as I2 ≥50% and P ≤0.1. If heterogeneity exists, the random-effect model will be used, and sensitivity analysis or subgroup analysis will be performed to further determine the source of heterogeneity.

It is endowed with huge diverse cattle genetic resources. The aim of this research was to determine the morphometric and potentioally adaptive characteristics of cattle populations. Multi-stage purposive and random sampling methods were employed to select the study areas, households and animals. A total of 1200 adult cattle were sampled and characterized for 14 qualitative and eight morphometric variables. The comparison of marginal means, chi-square tests, canonical discriminant analysis, and clustering analysis were employed using SAS and SPSS statistical software. The sex of the animal, location and agro-ecology were fitted as fixed effects in the model and had highly significant (p<0.001) effects for most body measurements. The chi-square test values of all categorical variables were significantly different (p<0.001) and potentioally adaptive characteristics such as coat colour type, navel flap, and tail length had higher association (> 0.45) values. White with red, light red, black and dark red were the most predominant coat colour types of cattle. The maximum hit rates were recorded in Enebsie and Sinan cattle. From five extracted canonical variate, (can1 and can2) accounted 75.4% and 78.8% in the female and male cattle populations, respectively. The canonical class has separated cattle populations of Sinan from Banja at can1 and Mecha from Sinan populations at can2. The square Mahalanobis distances between sites were significant (p<0.001) and the largest distance was found between Banja and Sinan locations. Cluster analysis result classified the study populations into four major cattle groups. The cumulative analysis results showed that the cattle populations of the study area can be categorized into four breed types as Jawi Sanga, Gojjam Zenga, Banja cattle, and Sinan cattle. However, this morphology based grouping need to be confirmed by molecular data.","The authors are grateful for the farmers who allowed us to mearure their animals for the linear measurement.

However, data on the performance of established influenza surveillance systems are limited in Africa, including Tanzania. We aimed to assess the usefulness of the Influenza surveillance system in Tanzania and to ascertain if the system meets its objectives, including; estimating the burden of disease caused by the Influenza virus in Tanzania and identifying any circulating viral strains with pandemic potential.
METHODOLOGY: From March to April 2021, we collected retrospective data through a review of the Tanzania National Influenza Surveillance System electronic forms for 2019. Furthermore, we interviewed the surveillance personnel about the system's description and operating procedures. Case definition (ILI-Influenza Like Illness and SARI-Severe Acute Respiratory Illness), results, and demographic characteristics of each patient were obtained from the Laboratory Information System (Disa*Lab) at Tanzania National Influenza Center. The United States Centers for disease control and prevention updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems were used to evaluate the system's attributes. Additionally, the system's performance indicators (including turnaround time) were obtained by evaluating Surveillance system attributes, each being scored on a scale of 1 to 5 (very poor to excellent performance).
RESULTS: A total of 1731 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were collected from each suspected influenza case in 2019 from fourteen (14/14) sentinel sites of the influenza surveillance system in Tanzania. Laboratory-confirmed cases were 21.5% (373/1731) with a predictive value positive of 21.7%. The majority of patients (76.1%) tested positive for Influenza A. Thirty-seven percent of patients' results met the required turnaround time, and 40% of case-based forms were incompletely filled. Although the accuracy of the data was good (100%), the consistency of the data was below (77%) the established target of ≥ 95%.
CONCLUSION: The overall system performance was satisfactory in conforming with its objectives and generating accurate data, with an average performance of 100%. The system's complexity contributed to the reduced consistency of data from sentinel sites to the National Public Health Laboratory of Tanzania. Improvement in the use of the available data could be made to inform and promote preventive measures, especially among the most vulnerable population. Increasing sentinel sites would increase population coverage and the level of system representativeness.","Sincere appreciation to the National Public Health Laboratory for technical support.

This qualitative descriptive study aimed to understand the experiences and well-being of essential workers across settings during the pandemic.
BACKGROUND: Multiple studies of the well-being of individuals who have cared for patients during the pandemic have included interviews of clinicians from acute care settings and revealed high levels of stress. However, other essential workers have not been included in most of those studies, yet they may also experience stress.
METHODS: Individuals who participated in an online study of anxiety, depression, traumatic distress, and insomnia, were invited to provide a free-text comment if they had anything to add. A total of 2,762 essential workers (e.g., nurses, physicians, chaplains, respiratory therapists, emergency medical technicians, housekeeping, and food service staff, etc.) participated in the study with 1,079 (39%) providing text responses. Thematic analysis was used to analyze those responses.
RESULTS: Four themes with eight sub-themes were: Facing hopelessness, yet looking for hope; Witnessing frequent death; Experiencing disillusionment and disruption within the healthcare system, and Escalating emotional and physical health problems.
CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed major psychological and physical stress among essential workers. Understanding highly stressful experiences during the pandemic is essential to identify strategies that ameliorate stress and prevent its negative consequences. This study adds to the research on the psychological and physical impact of the pandemic on workers, including non-clinical support personnel often overlooked as experiencing major negative effects.

In order to optimize the treatment for this disease, there is a need to develop objective tools to assess treatment response. Since a color change in the lesion is a good indicator of treatment response, we have developed a digital imaging system to quantify the values of red, green, and blue (RGB) difference and RGB ratio between the tumor and normal tissue to take into account the variations in color between different skin types. The efficacy of the proposed system in assessing treatment response in superficial IH was evaluated in relation to established visual and biochemical tools used to grade hemangiomas. As the treatment progressed, the RGB ratio was almost 1, while the RGB difference was close to 0, which indicates a good response to treatment. There was a strong correlation between the RGB score and the other visual grading systems. However, the correlation between the RGB scoring system and the biochemical method was weak. These findings suggest that the system can be used clinically to objectively and accurately evaluate disease progression and treatment response in patients diagnosed with superficial IH.",,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Child; Humans; Infant; Skin Neoplasms; Hemangioma; Disease Progression; Vascular Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome,2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,,18,3,e0282274,All OA; Gold,Article,"Xie, Mingfeng; Liu, Jianping; Zhou, Pingsheng; Xu, Xianyun; Liu, Haijin; Zeng, Linshan; Chen, Feng; Zeng, Yong; Huang, Haijin; Peng, Wei; Xiao, Hui; Liu, Qian","Xie, Mingfeng (Jiangxi Provincial Clinical Research Center for Vascular Anomalies, The First Affiliated Hospital of GanNan Medical University, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, China; Chinese & Western Integrative Medicine Discipline, Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; Jiangxi Key Laboratory of TCM for Prevention and Treatment on Hemangioma, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China); Liu, Jianping (Jiangxi Provincial Clinical Research Center for Vascular Anomalies, The First Affiliated Hospital of GanNan Medical University, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, China); Zhou, Pingsheng (Chinese & Western Integrative Medicine Discipline, Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; Jiangxi Key Laboratory of TCM for Prevention and Treatment on Hemangioma, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China); Xu, Xianyun (Chinese & Western Integrative Medicine Discipline, Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China); Liu, Haijin (Jiangxi Provincial Clinical Research Center for Vascular Anomalies, The First Affiliated Hospital of GanNan Medical University, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, China); Zeng, Linshan (Jiangxi Provincial Clinical Research Center for Vascular Anomalies, The First Affiliated Hospital of GanNan Medical University, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, China); Chen, Feng (Jiangxi Provincial Clinical Research Center for Vascular Anomalies, The First Affiliated Hospital of GanNan Medical University, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, China); Zeng, Yong (Jiangxi Provincial Clinical Research Center for Vascular Anomalies, The First Affiliated Hospital of GanNan Medical University, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, China); Huang, Haijin (Jiangxi Provincial Clinical Research Center for Vascular Anomalies, The First Affiliated Hospital of GanNan Medical University, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, China); Peng, Wei (Jiangxi Provincial Clinical Research Center for Vascular Anomalies, The First Affiliated Hospital of GanNan Medical University, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, China); Xiao, Hui (Chinese & Western Integrative Medicine Discipline, Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; Jiangxi Key Laboratory of TCM for Prevention and Treatment on Hemangioma, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China); Liu, Qian (Chinese & Western Integrative Medicine Discipline, Jiangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China; Jiangxi Key Laboratory of TCM for Prevention and Treatment on Hemangioma, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China)","Liu, Qian (Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; )","Xie, Mingfeng (First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University; Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Liu, Jianping (First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University); Zhou, Pingsheng (Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Xu, Xianyun (Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Liu, Haijin (First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University); Zeng, Linshan (First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University); Chen, Feng (First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University); Zeng, Yong (First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University); Huang, Haijin (First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University); Peng, Wei (First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University); Xiao, Hui (Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Liu, Qian (Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282274&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156335363,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

In the female Rhodnius prolixus, a blood-gorging triatomine and the vector of Chagas disease, we have identified the ecdysone response genes in the ovary using transcriptomic data. We then quantified the expression of the ecdysone response gene transcripts (E75, E74, BR-C, HR3, HR4, and FTZ-F1) in several tissues, including the ovary, following a blood meal. These results confirm the presence of these transcripts in several tissues in R. prolixus and show that the ecdysone response genes in the ovary are mostly upregulated during the first three days post blood meal (PBM). Knockdown of E75, E74, or FTZ-F1 transcripts using RNA interference (RNAi) was used to understand the role of the ecdysone response genes in vitellogenesis and egg production. Knockdown significantly decreases the expression of the transcripts for the ecdysone receptor and Halloween genes in the fat body and the ovaries and reduces the titer of ecdysteroid in the hemolymph. Knockdown of each of these transcription factors typically alters the expression of the other transcription factors. Knockdown also significantly decreases the expression of vitellogenin transcripts, Vg1 and Vg2, in the fat body and ovaries and reduces the number of eggs produced and laid. Some of the laid eggs have an irregular shape and smaller volume, and their hatching rate is decreased. Knockdown also influences the expression of the chorion gene transcripts Rp30 and Rp45. The overall effect of knockdown is a decrease in number of eggs produced and a severe reduction in number of eggs laid and their hatching rate.

The intermittent absence of workers from the home may adversely affect the health of the workers' families. This study synthesises research on mental and physical health outcomes in partners and children of rotation workers in the resources sector.
DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted. Studies were retrieved from PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Nineteen studies were included and findings were summarised narratively.
RESULTS: The impact of rotation work on the mental health and well-being of partners and children of rotation workers remains unclear. However, on days where workers are away, partners may experience greater loneliness and poorer sleep quality.
CONCLUSION: Partners may benefit from support, particularly when they have younger children and/or their spouses first begin rotation work. Research is limited, particularly regarding the impact on health-related behaviours and physical health outcomes.

Although health anxiety is related to both pandemic-related fears and perceptions of health risks, there is a paucity of research on individual difference variables that might exert an influence on these relationships. The present study examined intolerance of uncertainty (IU) as a potential moderator of the relationship between health anxiety and COVID-related stress, and the relationship between health anxiety and perceived risk of contracting COVID.Design and MethodsA nationally representative sample of North American adults (N = 204) completed self-report measures of health anxiety, IU, COVID-related stress, and perceived risk of contracting COVID.ResultsProspective IU moderated the positive relationship between health anxiety and COVID-related stress, as the relationship was strengthened at average and higher levels of prospective IU. Neither IU subscale moderated the relationship between health anxiety and perceived risk.ConclusionThese results suggest that individuals with elevated health anxiety and high prospective IU may be at higher risk of experiencing COVID-related stress, illuminating the interplay of risk factors that place anxious populations at an increased risk of experiencing stress during acute health risks.",,,Cognitive Therapy and Research,,,2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,,,,1-10,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Sorid, Samantha D.; Yap, David L.; Bravo, Adrian J.; Behar, Evelyn","Sorid, Samantha D.

500,pub.1156374153,10.1111/acer.15060,36941800,,Escalation of alcohol intake is associated with regionally decreased insular cortex activity but not associated with changes in taste quality,"BACKGROUND: Intermittent access to ethanol (EtOH) drives persistent escalation of intake and rapid transition from moderate to compulsive-like drinking. Intermittent EtOH drinking may facilitate escalation in part by altering aversion-sensitive neural substrates, such as the insular cortex (IC), thus driving greater approach toward stimuli previously treated as aversive.
METHODS: We conducted a series of experiments in rats to examine behavioral and neural responses associated with escalation of EtOH intake. First, taste reactivity analyses quantified the degree that intermittent brief-access ethanol exposure (BAEE) alters sensitivity to the aversive properties of EtOH. Next, we determined whether pharmacological IC inhibition facilitated EtOH escalation. Finally, given that IC is primary gustatory cortex, we employed psychophysical paradigms to assess whether escalation of EtOH intake induced changes in EtOH taste. These paradigms measured changes in sensitivity to the intensity of EtOH taste and whether escalation shifts the salient taste quality of EtOH by measuring the degree that the taste of EtOH generalized to a sucrose-like ('sweet') or quinine-like ('bitter') percept.
RESULTS: We found a near complete loss of aversive oromotor responses in EtOH-exposed relative to -naïve rats. Additionally, we observed significantly reduced expression of EtOH-induced c-Fos expression in the posterior IC in exposed rats relative to naïve rats. Inhibition of the IC resulted in a modest, but statistically reliable increase in acceptance of higher EtOH concentrations in naïve rats. Finally, we found no evidence of changes in the psychophysical assessment of the taste of EtOH in exposed, relative to naïve, rats.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that neural activity within the IC adapts following repeated presentations of EtOH in a manner that correlates with reduced sensitivity to the aversive hedonic properties of EtOH. These data further establish that alterations in IC activity may be driving exposure-induced escalations in EtOH intake.",,,Alcoholism Clinical and Experimental Research,,,2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,2023-03-20,,,,All OA; Green,Article,"Mukherjee, A.; Paladino, M.

500,pub.1156350162,10.1111/jcpp.13786,36941107,,Research Review: Integrated healthcare for children and young people in secondary/tertiary care – a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Children and young people (CYP) with comorbid physical and/or mental health conditions often struggle to receive a timely diagnosis, access specialist mental health care, and more likely to report unmet healthcare needs. Integrated healthcare is an increasingly explored model to support timely access, quality of care and better outcomes for CYP with comorbid conditions. Yet, studies evaluating the effectiveness of integrated care for paediatric populations are scarce.
AIM AND METHODS: This systematic review synthesises and evaluates the evidence for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrated care for CYP in secondary and tertiary healthcare settings. Studies were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases: Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Child Development and Adolescent Studies, ERIC, ASSIA and British Education Index.
FINDINGS: A total of 77 papers describing 67 unique studies met inclusion criteria. The findings suggest that integrated care models, particularly system of care and care coordination, improve access and user experience of care. The results on improving clinical outcomes and acute resource utilisation are mixed, largely due to the heterogeneity of studied interventions and outcome measures used. No definitive conclusion can be drawn on cost-effectiveness since studies focused mainly on costs of service delivery. The majority of studies were rated as weak by the quality appraisal tool used.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence of on clinical effectiveness of integrated healthcare models for paediatric populations is limited and of moderate quality. Available evidence is tentatively encouraging, particularly in regard to access and user experience of care. Given the lack of specificity by medical groups, however, the precise model of integration should be undertaken on a best-practice basis taking the specific parameters and contexts of the health and care environment into account. Agreed practical definitions of integrated care and associated key terms, and cost-effectiveness evaluations are a priority for future research.","Acknowledgements The authors have declared that they have no competing or potential conflicts of interest. Authors would like to thank Dr. Sohini Pawar and Mr Ryan Mak for their contribution to screening papers for this systematic review. Key points There is tentative encouraging evidence of improvement in access to care and patient experience when integrated intervention is part of clinical care, especially in secondary and tertiary services. As a general principle, implementation of integrated healthcare models is encouraged, however, given the lack of specificity of evidence by medical groups, the precise model of integration should be undertaken on a best‐practice basis taking the specific parameters of the health and care environment into account. Robust cost analysis using international definitions of cost variables is needed. These can then be calculated against international clinical outcome measures (e.g. quality of life) to inform future policy and practice protocols and allow for comparisons between healthcare models in different countries. The majority of evidence comes from US studies where healthcare is delivered by a fee for service system thus conclusions drawn may not transfer easily to other healthcare systems such as the NHS in the UK, which is free at the point of delivery.",,Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry,,,2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,2023-03-20,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Pygott, Naomi; Hartley, Alex; Seregni, Francesca; Ford, Tamsin J.; Goodyer, Ian M.; Necula, Andreea; Banu, Arina; Anderson, Joanna K.","Pygott, Naomi (Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK); Hartley, Alex (Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Department of Psychology, University of Bath, Bath, UK); Seregni, Francesca (Department of Paediatrics, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK); Ford, Tamsin J.

500,pub.1156345789,10.1073/pnas.2221049120,36940332,,Overcoming the adhesion paradox and switchability conflict on rough surfaces with shape-memory polymers,"Smart adhesives that can be applied and removed on demand play an important role in modern life and manufacturing. However, current smart adhesives made of elastomers suffer from the long-standing challenges of the adhesion paradox (rapid decrease in adhesion strength on rough surfaces despite adhesive molecular interactions) and the switchability conflict (trade-off between adhesion strength and easy detachment). Here, we report the use of shape-memory polymers (SMPs) to overcome the adhesion paradox and switchability conflict on rough surfaces. Utilizing the rubbery-glassy phase transition in SMPs, we demonstrate, through mechanical testing and mechanics modeling, that the conformal contact in the rubbery state followed by the shape-locking effect in the glassy state results in the so-called rubber-to-glass (R2G) adhesion (defined as making contact in the rubbery state to a certain indentation depth followed by detachment in the glassy state), with extraordinary adhesion strength (>1 MPa) proportional to the true surface area of a rough surface, overcoming the classic adhesion paradox. Furthermore, upon transitioning back to the rubbery state, the SMP adhesives can detach easily due to the shape-memory effect, leading to a simultaneous improvement in adhesion switchability (up to 103, defined as the ratio of the SMP R2G adhesion to its rubbery-state adhesion) as the surface roughness increases. The working principle and the mechanics model of R2G adhesion provide guidelines for developing stronger and more switchable adhesives adaptable to rough surfaces, thereby enhancing the capabilities of smart adhesives, and impacting various fields such as adhesive grippers and climbing robots.","We acknowledge financial support by the Ministry of Education (MOE) of Singapore under Academic Research Fund Tier 2 (T2EP50122-0001).

Although nonaqueous Li/Na/K-SeS2 batteries are attractive for their high energy density, the notorious shuttle effect of polysulfides/polyselenides and the intrinsic limitations of organic electrolyte have hindered the deployment of this technology. To circumvent these issues, here we design an aqueous Cu-SeS2 battery by encapsulating SeS2 in a defect-enriched nitrogen-doped porous carbon monolith. Except the intrinsic synergistic effect between Se and S in SeS2, the porous structure of carbon matrix has sufficient internal voids to buffer the volume change of SeS2 and provides abundant pathways for both electrons and ions. In addition, the synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and topological defect not only enhances the chemical affinity between reactants and carbon matrix but also offers catalytic active sites for electrochemical reactions. Benefiting from these merits, the Cu-SeS2 battery delivers superior initial reversible capacity of 1,905.1 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and outstanding long-span cycling performance over 1,000 cycles at 5 A g-1. This work applies variable valence charge carriers to aqueous metal-SeS2 batteries, providing valuable inspiration for the construction of metal-chalcogen batteries.","This work was supported by the Ningbo Natural Science Foundation (2022J064) and Nature Science Associate Foundation (NSAF, U1830106).",,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,2023-03-28,120,13,e2220792120,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Zhang, Junwei; Zhang, Xikun; Xu, Chiwei; Liu, Yiwen; Xu, Jiaxi; Miao, Zhonghao; Yu, Haoxiang; Yan, Lei; Zhang, Liyuan; Shu, Jie","Zhang, Junwei (School of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, 315211, China); Zhang, Xikun (School of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, 315211, China); Xu, Chiwei (School of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, 315211, China); Liu, Yiwen (School of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, 315211, China); Xu, Jiaxi (School of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, 315211, China); Miao, Zhonghao (School of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, 315211, China); Yu, Haoxiang (School of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, 315211, China); Yan, Lei (School of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, 315211, China); Zhang, Liyuan (School of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, 315211, China); Shu, Jie (School of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, 315211, China)","Shu, Jie (Ningbo University)","Zhang, Junwei (Ningbo University); Zhang, Xikun (Ningbo University); Xu, Chiwei (Ningbo University); Liu, Yiwen (Ningbo University); Xu, Jiaxi (Ningbo University); Miao, Zhonghao (Ningbo University); Yu, Haoxiang (Ningbo University); Yan, Lei (Ningbo University); Zhang, Liyuan (Ningbo University); Shu, Jie (Ningbo University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2220792120,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156345787,34 Chemical Sciences; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Although high-rate capability has been achieved based on the pillar effect of various intercalants for widening interlayer space, an in-depth understanding of atomic orbital variations induced by intercalants is still unknown. Herein, we design an NH4+-intercalated vanadium oxide (NH4+-V2O5) for high-rate ZIBs, together with deeply investigating the role of the intercalant in terms of atomic orbital. Besides extended layer spacing, our X-ray spectroscopies reveal that the insertion of NH4+ could promote electron transition to 3dxy state of V t2g orbital in V2O5, which significantly accelerates the electron transfer and Zn-ion migration, further verified by DFT calculations. As results, the NH4+-V2O5 electrode delivers a high capacity of 430.0 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, especially excellent rate capability (101.0 mA h g-1 at 200 C), enabling fast charging within 18 s. Moreover, the reversible V t2g orbital and lattice space variation during cycling are found via ex-situ soft X-ray absorption spectrum and in-situ synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction, respectively.

Here, we use scanning transmission electron microscopy to demonstrate a quantitative unit-cell-by-unit-cell mapping of the lattice parameters and octahedral rotations around misfit dislocations at the BiFeO3/SrRuO3 interface. We find that huge strain field is achieved near dislocations, i.e., above 5% within the first three unit cells of the core, which is typically larger than that achieved from the regular epitaxy thin-film approach, thus significantly altering the magnitude and direction of the local ferroelectric dipole in BiFeO3 and magnetic moments in SrRuO3 near the interface. The strain field and, thus, the structural distortion can be further tuned by the dislocation type. Our atomic-scale study helps us to understand the effects of dislocations in this ferroelectricity/ferromagnetism heterostructure. Such defect engineering allows us to tune the local ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order parameters and the interface electromagnetic coupling, providing new opportunities to design nanosized electronic and spintronic devices.","This research was supported by the National Key R&amp;D Program of China [2021YFA1400204 (X.B.)], National Natural Science Foundation of China [12104017 (X.L.), 52125307 (P.G.), 51991344 (X.B.), 52021006 (P.G.), T2188101 (P.G.)], the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB33030200 (X.B.), ZDYZ2015-1 (X.B.)], and “2011 Program” Peking-Tsinghua-IOP Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter, and open research fund of Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory [2022SLABFK03 (P.G.), 2021SLABFN14 (C.T.)], the Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [2021JJ30234 (C.T.)], the Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department [21A0311 (C.T.)], and the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory Program [Grant No. 2021B 1212040001 (C.T.)].

This paper's primary objective is to investigate the role of relative deprivation and inequality in explaining the daily spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. For this purpose, we use secondary cross-sectional data across 119 (developed and developing) countries from January 2020 – to April 2021. For the empirical analysis, we use a recent dynamic panel data modelling approach that allows us to identify the role of time-invariant variables such as degree of globalisation, political freedom and income inequality on the dynamics of the pandemic and fatality rates across countries. We find that new cases per million and fatality rates are highly persistent processes. After controlling for time-varying mobility statistics from the Google mobility database and region-specific dummy variables, the two significant factors that explain the severity of Covid-19 spread in a country are per-capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Yitzhaki's relative income deprivation index. Lagged value of new cases per million significantly explains cross-country variations in the daily case fatality rates. A higher proportion of the older population and pollution increased fatality rates while better medical infrastructure reduced it.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.,The authors gratefully acknowledge the funds received under the Covid-19 Supplementary Funding Pool Scheme from Charles Darwin University to undertake this research.,Social Science & Medicine,,,2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,2023-03,,,115858,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Chakrabarty, Debajyoti; Bhatia, Bhanu; Jayasinghe, Maneka; Low, David","Chakrabarty, Debajyoti (Asia Pacific College of Business and Law, Charles Darwin University, 21 Kitchener Dr. Waterfront, Darwin City, Northern Territory, 0800, Australia); Bhatia, Bhanu (Asia Pacific College of Business and Law, Charles Darwin University, 21 Kitchener Dr. Waterfront, Darwin City, Northern Territory, 0800, Australia); Jayasinghe, Maneka (Asia Pacific College of Business and Law, Charles Darwin University, 21 Kitchener Dr. Waterfront, Darwin City, Northern Territory, 0800, Australia); Low, David (Asia Pacific College of Business and Law, Charles Darwin University, 21 Kitchener Dr. Waterfront, Darwin City, Northern Territory, 0800, Australia)","Chakrabarty, Debajyoti (Charles Darwin University)","Chakrabarty, Debajyoti (Charles Darwin University); Bhatia, Bhanu (Charles Darwin University); Jayasinghe, Maneka (Charles Darwin University); Low, David (Charles Darwin University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.115858,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156344365,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics,10 Reduced Inequalities

To explore how social distancing shaped students’ academic and social networks and associated educational outcomes, we conceptualized it as a “network shock” and collected unique ego network data in April 2020. For participating students, maintaining interactions with the same set of individuals before and after social distancing was related to more positive outcomes across a range of self-reported wellbeing and learning indicators. On average, students experienced a loss of frequent academic contacts, while they maintained or replaced social interactions in their interpersonal networks after social distancing. Our investigation of the ways students experienced changes in their social and academic networks after a loss of physical proximity points to the role of interpersonal interaction network continuity for fostering wellbeing and learning in times of disruption, as well as the potential need for support in maintaining or rebuilding academic networks.",,No funding was received to assist with the preparation of this manuscript.,Innovative Higher Education,,,2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,,,,1-20,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Smith, Rachel A.; Brown, Michael G.; Schiltz, James J.; Sowl, Stephanie; Schulz, Jessica M.; Grady, Kevin A.","Smith, Rachel A.

The success of online learning is primarily based on the quality of the information systems, self-regulated learning, and intrinsic learning motivation. The severe stress amid epidemic lockdowns might trigger negative impacts on students’ learning motivation and self-regulated learning. Nevertheless, studies examining the relationship between information system success, self-regulated learning, perceived stress, and intrinsic learning motivation in the context of developing countries are still scarce. The current research aims to address this gap in the literature. Participants were 303 university students. The results of second-order structural equation modelling revealed the positive direct and indirect relationships between information system success, intrinsic learning motivation, and online self-regulated learning. Besides, despite the insignificant relationships between perceived stress, intrinsic learning motivation, and online self-regulated learning, most participants in this study were found to have moderate to high stress levels. Hence, the potential adverse effect of stress on students’ learning process should not be ignored. The results provide implications for educators and researchers studying online learning environments and educational psychology.","This study was fund by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [Grant number MOST 108-2511-H-011 -007-MY2 and MOST 110-2511-H-011 -003 -MY3].

Those methods need a large number of datasets including all variations in their training stages. On the other hand, medical images are always scarce due to several reasons, such as not enough patients for some diseases, patients do not want to allow their images to be used, lack of medical equipment or equipment, inability to obtain images that meet the desired criteria. This issue leads to bias in datasets, overfitting, and inaccurate results. Data augmentation is a common solution to overcome this issue and various augmentation techniques have been applied to different types of images in the literature. However, it is not clear which data augmentation technique provides more efficient results for which image type since different diseases are handled, different network architectures are used, and these architectures are trained and tested with different numbers of data sets in the literature. Therefore, in this work, the augmentation techniques used to improve performances of deep learning based diagnosis of the diseases in different organs (brain, lung, breast, and eye) from different imaging modalities (MR, CT, mammography, and fundoscopy) have been examined. Also, the most commonly used augmentation methods have been implemented, and their effectiveness in classifications with a deep network has been discussed based on quantitative performance evaluations.

However, it is unclear whether this impact of pleasant music holds regardless of how arousing the music is, and what influence, if any, music-induced aesthetic emotions have. Furthermore, most music EM studies have used verbal or facial memory tasks limiting the generalisability of these findings to everyday EMs with spatiotemporal richness. The current study used an online what-where-when paradigm to assess music's influence on EM encoding in a rich spatiotemporal environment. 105 participants carried out the what-where-when task in the presence of either silence or one of four musical stimuli falling into the four corners of the 2-D circumplex emotion model. We observed an interaction effect between the pleasantness and arousingness of music stimuli, whereby for pleasant stimuli, the low arousing excerpt was associated with better recall performance compared to the high arousing excerpt. We also observed that, across all excerpts, experience of negative aesthetic emotions was associated with compromised recall performance. Together, our results confirm the deleterious influence arousing stimuli can have on memory and support the notion that aesthetic-emotional experience of music can influence how memories are encoded in everyday life.","The authors thank the participants who took part in the study, and their reviewers.",,Cognition & Emotion,,,2023-03-20,2023,2023-03-20,2023-03-20,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-9,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Nawaz, Safiyyah; Omigie, Diana","Nawaz, Safiyyah (Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths University of London, London, UK); Omigie, Diana (Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths University of London, London, UK)","Nawaz, Safiyyah (Goldsmiths University of London)","Nawaz, Safiyyah (Goldsmiths University of London); Omigie, Diana (Goldsmiths University of London)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2023.2185206,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156340089,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health; 52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

Forum data and self-reported data from 116 online college students were analyzed at two different timepoints. We found received social support is not related to learning burnout but shows a positive relationship with cognitive engagement that increases over time. Perceived social support is always positively correlated with cognitive engagement and negatively associated with learning burnout. Cognitive engagement has a negative relation with learning burnout that increases over time. Moreover, the negative relationship between learning burnout and performance emerges in the middle of the term but not at the end, thus indicating a significant change over time.

Physical inactivity, depression, and chronic pain are major problems faced by SCI survivors discharged from the acute phase of treatment or inpatient rehabilitation. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of a Physical-Psychological Integrative (PPI) online group intervention on community-dwelling SCI survivors' physical activity, depression, and chronic pain.
METHODS: This is a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial with repeated measures (pre-, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up) design. Seventy-two participants will be randomly assigned to two study groups. The PPI intervention group will receive a video program for physical activity training and eight-week online group psychological interventions using skills of group-based motivational interviewing and mindfulness-based stress reduction. The control group will receive an eight-week online didactic education programed. Focus-group interviews will be conducted post-intervention to explore their views about acceptance and suggested improvements to the intervention. The feasibility of study procedures and the acceptability of interventions will be evaluated. The effectiveness of the PPI intervention will be evaluated by leisure-time physical activity, depression, chronic pain, exercise efficacy, mindfulness, and quality of life. We will use the generalized estimating equation to assess intervention effects and content analysis for interview data. This study has received ethical approval from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HSEARS20210705004) and was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05535400).
DISCUSSION: This study will be the first to provide empirical data on the evaluation of an online-group intervention integrating both physical activity promotion and psychological approaches, aimed at reducing physical inactivity, depression, and chronic pain for community-dwelling SCI survivors in Hong Kong. The findings could provide evidence supporting the use of PPI intervention as a novel online group support, in addressing both the physical and psychological needs of community-dwelling SCI survivors.",,"This study is funded by the Health and Medical Research Fund Research Fellowship Scheme, the Health Bureau, Hong Kong SAR (Project No. 06200147).

500,pub.1156328840,10.1002/erv.2977,36934407,,Parental dieting impacts inpatient treatment outcomes for adolescents with restrictive eating disorders,"OBJECTIVE: Parental feeding practices and disordered eating are potential risk factors for the development of disordered eating in children and adolescents. This study measured the relationship between parental dieting behaviours and inpatient treatment outcomes for adolescents with restrictive eating disorders (EDs).
METHOD: Parents of adolescents with restrictive EDs (N = 45) admitted to a specialty integrated inpatient-partial hospital meal-based ED treatment programme completed questionnaires assessing parental eating and exercise behaviours. Adolescent clinical data, including percentage median body mass index (%mBMI) at admission and discharge and rate of weight gain, were abstracted from the electronic medical record.
RESULTS: Adolescents whose parents reported dieting had a slower rate of weight gain (3.47 lbs./week) compared to participants whose parents were not dieting (4.54 lbs./week; p = 0.017). Additionally, participants whose parents reported dieting had a lower %mBMI at programme discharge (M = 93.56) than participants whose parents did not report dieting (M = 95.99; p = 0.033).
CONCLUSION: Parental dieting behaviours may impact an adolescent's response to inpatient ED treatment. Findings suggest a need to assess parental dieting behaviour, and when appropriate, provide additional psychoeducation regarding the potential risks of weight or shape-focussed dialogue and the benefits of modelling adaptive meal behaviours.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported in part by the Stephen and Jean Robinson Professorship Fund.

However, we know little about how CVR is affected by dementia risk, prior to disease onset. Understanding this relationship would improve our knowledge of disease pathways and help inform preventative interventions. This systematic review investigates 59 studies examining how CVR (measured by magnetic resonance imaging) is affected by modifiable, non-modifiable, and clinical risk factors for dementia. We report that non-modifiable risk (older age and apolipoprotein ε4), some modifiable factors (diabetes, traumatic brain injury, hypertension) and some clinical factors (stroke, carotid artery occlusion, stenosis) were consistently associated with reduced CVR. We also note a lack of conclusive evidence on how other behavioural factors such as physical inactivity, obesity, or depression, affect CVR. This review explores the biological mechanisms underpinning these brain- behaviour associations, highlights evident gaps in the literature, and identifies the risk factors that could be managed to preserve CVR in an effort to prevent dementia.",,"Work on this study is supported by the Academy of Medical Sciences/the Wellcome Trust/the Government Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy/the British Heart Foundation [SBF006\1078] to SS, an Alzheimer’s Society Research Fellowship to SS [Grant Reference: 441], an EPSRC grant to DB [EP/S021507/1], a Clarendon fund to GH, the UK National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) and the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging (WIN).

METHODS: The data come from a US national survey (N=3,973 aged 32-84 at cognitive testing in 2004-06, mean age 56.6, 56.3% female; N=3,055 retested in 2013-18 at ages 42-94, mean age 64.6, 56.6% female; mortality follow-up through 2019). We use Cox hazard models to investigate whether cognition is associated with mortality below age 65, how the magnitude of this risk compares with the risk in later life, and whether the association persists after adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Worse cognition is associated with mortality, but the demographic-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) diminishes with age from 2.0 per SD (95% CI 1.7-2.4) at age 55 to 1.4 (95% CI 1.3-1.6) at age 85. In the fully-adjusted model, the corresponding HRs are 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.7) and 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.4), respectively. The absolute differences in mortality by level of cognition, however, are larger at older ages because mortality is rare at younger ages. The fully-adjusted model implies a 2.7-percentage point differential in the estimated percentage dying between ages 55 and 65 for those with low cognition (1 SD below the overall mean, 5.7%) vs. high cognition (1 SD above the mean, 3.0%). The corresponding differential between age 75 and 85 is 8.4 percentage points (24.6% vs. 16.2%, respectively).

We aimed to longitudinally investigate the bidirectional association between SQ and GS and the mediating role of depression in this association.
METHODS: Based on two nationally representative samples with people aged ≥ 50 years from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS; 4,200 participants) and English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA; 5,922 participants), cross-lagged panel models were employed to examine the potential bidirectional relationships between objectively measured GS and self-reported SQ.
RESULTS: We observed a GS-SQ bidirectional association dominated by GS. After adjusting for potential confounders, a higher GS at T1 predicted better SQ at T2 (ELSA: β = 0.075; CHARLS: β = 0.104, P < 0.001) and vice versa (ELSA: β = 0.034; CHARLS: β = 0.030, P < 0.01). Moreover, depression partially mediated the impact of GS on subsequent SQ (ELSA, indirect effect: 0.0057, 95% CI: [0.0035-0.0084]; CHARLS, indirect effect: 0.0086, 95% confidence interval: [0.0051, 0.0131]), but not vice versa.
CONCLUSIONS: The results regarding data from both cohorts consistently supported a bidirectional association between GS and SQ and the mediating role of depression in the dominant pathway of this bidirectional relationship. Older adults with a low GS should be made aware of a potentially vicious cycle related to depression that can affect their sleep. Regular screening for depression may help to break this cycle.",,,The Journals of Gerontology Series A,,,2023-03-19,2023,2023-03-19,2023-03-19,,,,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Han, Qiang; Hu, Wei; Sun, Na; Chu, Jiadong; Chen, Xuanli; Li, Tongxing; He, Qida; Feng, Zhaolong; Shen, Yueping","Han, Qiang (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China.); Hu, Wei (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China.); Sun, Na (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China.); Chu, Jiadong (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China.); Chen, Xuanli (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China.); Li, Tongxing (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China.); He, Qida (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China.); Feng, Zhaolong (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China.); Shen, Yueping (Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China.)",,"Han, Qiang (Soochow University); Hu, Wei (Soochow University); Sun, Na (Soochow University); Chu, Jiadong (Soochow University); Chen, Xuanli (Soochow University); Li, Tongxing (Soochow University); He, Qida (Soochow University); Feng, Zhaolong (Soochow University); Shen, Yueping (Soochow University)",0,0,,,https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/gerona/glad084/49561128/glad084.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156329616,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,
500,pub.1156329593,10.1093/schbul/sbad017,36934309,,Socioenvironmental Adversity and Adolescent Psychotic Experiences: Exploring Potential Mechanisms in a UK Longitudinal Cohort.,"BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Children exposed to socioenvironmental adversities (eg, urbanicity, pollution, neighborhood deprivation, crime, and family disadvantage) are more likely to subsequently develop subclinical psychotic experiences during adolescence (eg, hearing voices, paranoia). However, the pathways through which this occurs have not been previously investigated. We hypothesized that cognitive ability and inflammation would partly explain this association.
STUDY DESIGN: Data were utilized from the Environmental-Risk Longitudinal Twin Study, a cohort of 2232 children born in 1994-1995 in England and Wales and followed to age 18. Socioenvironmental adversities were measured from birth to age 10 and classified into physical risk (defined by high urbanicity and air pollution) and socioeconomic risk (defined by high neighborhood deprivation, neighborhood disorder, and family disadvantage). Cognitive abilities (overall, crystallized, fluid, and working memory) were assessed at age 12; and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor) were measured at age 18 from blood samples. Participants were interviewed at age 18 regarding psychotic experiences.
STUDY RESULTS: Higher physical risk and socioeconomic risk were associated with increased odds of psychotic experiences in adolescence. The largest mediation pathways were from socioeconomic risk via overall cognitive ability and crystallized ability, which accounted for ~11% and ~19% of the association with psychotic experiences, respectively.

Such a bias may protect individuals from harm. Consistent with this idea, lower loss aversion has been measured in individuals who endorse current cigarette smoking as well as other substance use compared to controls matched on important sociodemographic variables (age, gender, educational attainment). The goal of the present study was to systematically replicate and extend this association between loss aversion and smoking status by comparing those meeting criteria for current-, former-, and never-smoking status.
METHODS: 984 individuals (N=984) that endorsed current cigarette-smoking (past 30-day use; n=361), former-smoking (no past 30-day use, >100 cigarettes lifetime; n=317), and never-smoking (No past 30-day use, <100 cigarettes lifetime; n=306) were recruited using standard crowdsourcing methods and completed measures of loss aversion (50-50 gambles) and delay discounting (monetary choice questionnaire), an important decision-making bias with an established relationship to cigarette smoking status.
RESULTS: Lower loss aversion was observed in those endorsing current smoking compared to former-smoking [t(952)=-9.57, Bonferroni corrected p<.0001], and never-smoking [t(952)=-3.99, Bonferroni corrected p=.0002]. Loss aversion was also greater in former- compared to the never-smoking [t(952)=-5.26, Bonferroni corrected p<.0001]. This pattern did not change when accounting for delay discounting and sociodemographics. Delay discounting results replicated prior findings.
CONCLUSIONS: The results support loss aversion as a decision-making bias related to risk for cigarette smoking and other substance use. Further research is needed to understand the causal contributions of loss aversion and delay discounting and their potential intersections.
SIGNIFICANCE: Low loss aversion is a risk factor for cigarette smoking. This study reports higher loss aversion among individuals that endorsed never-smoking and former-smoking status in comparison to those endorsing current cigarette smoking. Loss aversion may influence or be influenced by a change in smoking status.",,,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,,,2023-03-19,2023,2023-03-19,2023-03-19,,,,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Thrailkill, Eric A; DeSarno, Michael; Higgins, Stephen T","Thrailkill, Eric A (Vermont Center on Behavior and Health, Burlington VT, USA.; Department of Psychological Science, University of Vermont, Burlington VT, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Vermont, Burlington VT, USA.); DeSarno, Michael (Vermont Center on Behavior and Health, Burlington VT, USA.; Department of Biomedical Statistics, University of Vermont, Burlington VT, USA.); Higgins, Stephen T (Vermont Center on Behavior and Health, Burlington VT, USA.; Department of Psychological Science, University of Vermont, Burlington VT, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Vermont, Burlington VT, USA.)",,"Thrailkill, Eric A (University of Vermont; University of Vermont); DeSarno, Michael (University of Vermont); Higgins, Stephen T (University of Vermont; University of Vermont)",0,0,,,https://academic.oup.com/ntr/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/ntr/ntad043/49561145/ntad043.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156329608,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

In this letter, we specify a generative model for such data and derive a variational algorithm for inferring the transformation of each model object in a scene and the assignments of observed parts to the objects. We derive a learning algorithm for the object models, based on variational expectation maximization (Jordan et al., 1999). We also study an alternative inference algorithm based on the RANSAC method of Fischler and Bolles (1981). We apply these inference methods to data generated from multiple geometric objects like squares and triangles (""constellations"") and data from a parts-based model of faces. Recent work by Kosiorek et al. (2019) has used amortized inference via stacked capsule autoencoders to tackle this problem; our results show that we significantly outperform them where we can make comparisons (on the constellations data).","We thank the anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

Previous approaches propose to learn such temporal abstractions in an unsupervised fashion through observing state-action trajectories gathered from executing a policy. However, a current limitation is that they process each trajectory in an entirely sequential manner, which prevents them from revising earlier decisions about subroutine boundary points in light of new incoming information. In this work, we propose slot-based transformer for temporal abstraction (SloTTAr), a fully parallel approach that integrates sequence processing transformers with a slot attention module to discover subroutines in an unsupervised fashion while leveraging adaptive computation for learning about the number of such subroutines solely based on their empirical distribution. We demonstrate how SloTTAr is capable of outperforming strong baselines in terms of boundary point discovery, even for sequences containing variable amounts of subroutines, while being up to seven times faster to train on existing benchmarks.","We thank Aditya Ramesh, Aleksandar Stanić, and Klaus Greff for useful discussions and valuable feedback.

We hypothesize that the complex dynamics produced by networks of complex and heterogeneous neurons may contribute to the brain's ability to process and respond to temporally complex data. To study the role of complex and heterogeneous neuronal dynamics in network computation, we develop a rate-based neuronal model, the generalized-leaky-integrate-and-fire-rate (GLIFR) model, which is a rate equivalent of the generalized-leaky-integrate-and-fire model. The GLIFR model has multiple dynamical mechanisms, which add to the complexity of its activity while maintaining differentiability. We focus on the role of after-spike currents, currents induced or modulated by neuronal spikes, in producing rich temporal dynamics. We use machine learning techniques to learn both synaptic weights and parameters underlying intrinsic dynamics to solve temporal tasks. The GLIFR model allows the use of standard gradient descent techniques rather than surrogate gradient descent, which has been used in spiking neural networks. After establishing the ability to optimize parameters using gradient descent in single neurons, we ask how networks of GLIFR neurons learn and perform on temporally challenging tasks, such as sequential MNIST. We find that these networks learn diverse parameters, which gives rise to diversity in neuronal dynamics, as demonstrated by clustering of neuronal parameters. GLIFR networks have mixed performance when compared to vanilla recurrent neural networks, with higher performance in pixel-by-pixel MNIST but lower in line-by-line MNIST. However, they appear to be more robust to random silencing. We find that the ability to learn heterogeneity and the presence of after-spike currents contribute to these gains in performance. Our work demonstrates both the computational robustness of neuronal complexity and diversity in networks and a feasible method of training such models using exact gradients.","We acknowledge the following sources of funding and support: the University of Washington Mary Gates Research Endowment, NIH training grant T90 DA 32436-10, and NIH BRAIN initiative grant 1RF1DA055669.

We investigated the predictive value of ER difficulties on problematic gaming (PG) considering age groups (children vs. youths) and gender cross-sectionally and prospectively in a representative sample of German adolescents via online survey with two measurement points 14 months apart. General Poisson, logistic, and multinomial regression models were estimated to predict gaming patterns by ER difficulties controlling for age group and gender. Results revealed ER difficulties to be significantly associated with PG. Moreover, subgroup analyses indicated differing ER patterns for children vs. youths and boys vs. girls: for children, higher PG values were associated with emotional awareness and emotional clarity whereas for youths it was the acceptance of emotional responses. Moreover, gender differences implicated that boys with PG had more deficits in goal-oriented behavior as well as emotional awareness while affected girls were lacking emotional clarity and had problems with the acceptance of their emotional responses. Interestingly, procrastination was a significant predictor for PG irrespective of subgroups. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses indicated that difficulties in ER promoted PG while stronger procrastination tendencies maintained it. With the inclusion of procrastination, which can be understood as a maladaptive ER strategy, a broader picture of ER difficulties as a risk factor for PG could be drawn.

This study aimed to compare the effect of two best practice TS regimens on thiamine blood levels (i.e. thiamine pyrophosphate, TPP) and cognitive function.
METHODS: In 50 patients undergoing in-patient alcohol-withdrawal treatment, TPP levels were determined at baseline and end of weeks 1, 2 and 8 following administration of oral TS (3 × 100 mg/day for 7 days followed by 1 × 100 mg/day thereafter) either with or without preceding intravenous TS (3 × 100 mg/day for 5 days). An extensive psychiatric assessment was conducted at baseline, including an evaluation of AUD severity and depressive symptoms. Additionally, cognitive function and depressive symptoms were repeatedly evaluated.
RESULTS: Relevant increases (mean increase by 100.2 nmol/l [CI 76.5-123.8], P < 0.001) in peripheral blood TPP levels were observed in all patients at the end of weeks 1 and 2. Furthermore, no relevant difference between the intravenous and the oral group was found (average difference between increases: 2.3 nmol/l, P = 0.912). Importantly, an association between the 'extent of the response' to TS and the performance in a memory task was revealed in secondary analyses.
CONCLUSION: TS was associated with improving cognitive function in patients with AUD, independently of the substitution regime. Thus, in clinical practice, oral TS might be a sufficient but obligatory medication to prevent cognitive decline in AUD in the absence of Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome.",,,Alcohol and Alcoholism,,,2023-03-18,2023,2023-03-18,2023-03-18,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Listabarth, Stephan; Vyssoki, Benjamin; Marculescu, Rodrig; Gleiss, Andreas; Groemer, Magdalena; Trojer, Armin; Harrer, Christine; Weber, Sabine; König, Daniel","Listabarth, Stephan (Clinical Division of Social Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.); Vyssoki, Benjamin (Clinical Division of Social Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.); Marculescu, Rodrig (Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.); Gleiss, Andreas (Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Institute of Clinical Biometrics, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.); Groemer, Magdalena (Clinical Division of Social Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.); Trojer, Armin (Clinical Division of Social Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.); Harrer, Christine (Clinical Division of Social Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.); Weber, Sabine (Clinical Division of Social Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.); König, Daniel (Clinical Division of Social Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.)",,"Listabarth, Stephan (Medical University of Vienna); Vyssoki, Benjamin (Medical University of Vienna); Marculescu, Rodrig (Medical University of Vienna); Gleiss, Andreas (Medical University of Vienna); Groemer, Magdalena (Medical University of Vienna); Trojer, Armin (Medical University of Vienna); Harrer, Christine (Medical University of Vienna); Weber, Sabine (Medical University of Vienna); König, Daniel (Medical University of Vienna)",0,0,,,https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/alcalc/agad017/49558446/agad017.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156330234,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being

While recent years have seen many methodological advancements in computational modelling and many cross-sectional patient studies, much less attention has been paid to basic psychometric properties (reliability and construct validity) of the computational measures provided by the assays. In this review, we assess the extent of this issue by examining emerging empirical evidence. We find that many computational measures suffer from poor psychometric properties, which poses a risk of invalidating previous findings and undermining ongoing research efforts using computational assays to study individual (and even group) differences. We provide recommendations for how to address these problems and, crucially, embed them within a broader perspective on key developments that are needed for translating computational assays to clinical practice.","Acknowledgments PK is supported by CIHR Fellowship.

This is especially true of children who, historically overlooked and marginalized, are labeled “at risk.” While research has focused on pervasive stressors as obstacles to these classroom professionals (e.g., teacher/teaching stress, curricular mandates, quality assessments, COVID-19), there is less research on stress in relation to the formation of teacher identity; specifically, how stress contributes to and detracts from the formation of a teacher’s micro-identity, and how negative impacts of stress to the micro-identity may contribute to teachers’ decisions to leave the field. Although once considered to be one of the fastest growing industries, The Great Resignation, as it has come to be known, estimates up to 25–30% of the workforce leave annually. To better understand the choices teachers make to leave the profession, the current study examined the influence of stress on teachers’ microidentity by centering the voices of six Head Start teachers. Implementing a qualitative design, this investigation asked (a) Who are the Head Start teachers in the workforce today? (b) What are the particular stressors with which they contend? (c) How does the micro-identity of these teachers change as a result of stress, and what are the potential choices that follow? Results and findings indicated that Head Start teachers experience (1) stress as reality, (2) stress-shaped identities, and (3) identity-mediated choice. Implications and insights are discussed.","Grateful acknowledgment is due to the six teachers of this qualitative study, AM, AN, JM, RH, SB, and SS, without whom the early childhood workforce would be less understood.

RationaleThe endocannabinoid system makes critical contributions to reward processing, motivation, and behavioral control. Repeated exposure to THC or other cannabinoid drugs can cause persistent adaptions in the endocannabinoid system and associated neural circuitry. It remains unclear how such treatments affect the way rewards are processed and pursued.Objective and methodsWe examined if repeated THC exposure (5 mg/kg/day for 14 days) during adolescence or adulthood led to long-term changes in rats’ capacity to flexibly encode and use action-outcome associations for goal-directed decision making. Effects on hedonic feeding and progressive ratio responding were also assessed.ResultsTHC exposure had no effect on rats’ ability to flexibly select actions following reward devaluation. However, instrumental contingency degradation learning, which involves avoiding an action that is unnecessary for reward delivery, was augmented in rats with a history of adult but not adolescent THC exposure. THC-exposed rats also displayed more vigorous instrumental behavior in this study, suggesting a motivational enhancement. A separate experiment found that while THC exposure had no effect on hedonic feeding behavior, it increased rats’ willingness to work for food on a progressive ratio schedule, an effect that was more pronounced when THC was administered to adults. Adolescent and adult THC exposure had opposing effects on the CB1 receptor dependence of progressive ratio performance, decreasing and increasing sensitivity to rimonabant-induced behavioral suppression, respectively.ConclusionsOur findings reveal that exposure to a translationally relevant THC exposure regimen induces long-lasting, age-dependent alterations in cognitive and motivational processes that regulate the pursuit of rewards.",We thank Johanna Montesinos for assisting with animal pretreatment.,"This research was supported by a pilot grant from NIDA P50 award DA044118 and NIH grants MH126285 (SBO), DA046667 (SBO), DA050116 (BH), P50 DA044118 (SVM), and U01DA053826 (SVM).",Psychopharmacology,,,2023-03-18,2023,2023-03-18,2023-03-18,,,1-17,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Halbout, Briac; Hutson, Collin; Hua, Leann; Inshishian, Victoria; Mahler, Stephen V.; Ostlund, Sean B.","Halbout, Briac (Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine, University of California, 92697, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA); Hutson, Collin (Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine, University of California, 92697, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA); Hua, Leann (Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Care, School of Medicine, University of California, 92697, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA); Inshishian, Victoria (Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, School of Biological Sciences, University of California, 92697, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA); Mahler, Stephen V.

Parents or caregivers of 237 ASD children (193 boys, 44 girls) diagnosed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) completed a simple descriptive questionnaire. The data were analyzed using the variable-centered multiple regression analysis and the person-centered classification tree method. We believed that the concurrent use of these two methods could produce robust results. The mean age at diagnosis was 5.8 ± 2.2 years (median 5.3 years). Younger ages for ASD diagnosis were predicted (using multiple regression analysis) by higher scores in the ADOS social domain, higher scores in ADOS restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interest domain, higher maternal education, and the shared household of parents. Using the classification tree method, the subgroup with the lowest mean age at diagnosis were children, in whom the summation of ADOS communication and social domain scores was ≥ 17, and paternal age at the delivery was ≥ 29 years. In contrast, the subgroup with the oldest mean age at diagnosis included children with summed ADOS communication and social domain scores < 17 and maternal education at the elementary school level. The severity of autism and maternal education played a significant role in both types of data analysis focused on age at diagnosis.","The authors would like to thank Thomas Secrest, MSc., for his assistance with the English version of the manuscript.","Open access publishing supported by the National Technical Library in Prague.

Our previous work has shown that chicks prefer to approach agents whose main body axis and motion direction are aligned (a feature typical of creatures whose motion is constrained by a bilaterally symmetric body plan). However, it has never been investigated whether chicks are also sensitive to the fact that an agent maintains a stable front–back body orientation in motion (i.e. consistency in which end is leading and which trailing). This is another feature typical of bilateria, which is also associated with the detection of animate agents in humans. The aim of the present study was to fill this gap. Contrary to our initial expectations, after testing 300 chicks across 3 experimental conditions, we found a recurrent preference for the agent which did not maintain a stable front–back body orientation. Since this preference was limited to female chicks, the results are discussed also in relation to sex differences in the social behaviour of this model. Overall, we show for the first time that chicks can discriminate agents based on the stability of their front–back orientation. The unexpected direction of the effect could reflect a preference for agents’ whose behaviour is less predictable. Chicks may prefer agents with greater behavioural variability, a trait which has been associated with animate agents, or have a tendency to explore agents performing “odd behaviours”.",,"Open access funding provided by Università degli Studi di Trento within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

Currently there is limited number of tools that can be used to support the ABN method and so this article presents the design and development of two tools that facilitate learning with this method, a physical device, ABENEARIO-P, and a virtual device (web application), ABENEARIO-V, that complements the physical device. In addition, a study of the use of these tools was carried out with 80 learners (ages 7 and 9) and 9 teachers with a focus on ABENEARIO-V. The results of this study showed a positive evaluation of the tool by both learners and teachers, an adequate time to complete the mathematical operations assigned to learners and an improvement in performance as the tool was used. As a conclusion, it is important to provide adequate tools that can support teachers and learners in the practice with the ABN method as in the case of ABENEARIO-P and ABENEARIO-V.

This study aims to examine trends in availability of CPCS over time and rural-urban disparities in service availability among nationwide oldest-old in China.
METHODS: Multiple cross-sectional data were derived from the 2005-2018 Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey. Service availability was reported by each oldest-old participant or their next-of-kins as having CPCS in one's neighborhood. We used Cochran-Armitage tests to estimate service availability trends and applied sample-weighted logistic regression models to examine its rural-urban disparities.
RESULTS: Of 38,032 oldest-old, CPCS availability decreased from 6.7 % in 2005 to 4.8 % in 2008/2009, followed by continual increases to 13.6 % in 2017/2018. In 2017/2018, rural oldest-old's neighborhoods had no greater service availability. Oldest-old residing in the Central (6.7 %), Western (13.4 %) and Northeast China (8.1 %) were less likely to report having services locally than their Eastern counterparts (17.8 %). Oldest-old having any disability or living in the nursing homes reported having greater service availability than those without disability or living at home.
LIMITATION: Service availability might have disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increasing service availability, as of 2017/2018, only 13.6 % oldest-old in China had reported CPCS availability. It raises concerns on the disproportionate access to and continuity of mental health care, especially for those living the Central, Western China and those living at home.

These parties have demonstrated their ability to shift from protest to governing parties, consequently shifting experts’ attention toward the effects of populism in power on democratic institutions. In light of examples in South America and Easter Europe, scholarly debate has centered on concerns that populist governments will deform democracy and democratic institutions, limit institutions and reduce both checks and balances and pluralism. Here we argue that in the context of a consolidated western democracy, populist governments identify themselves with government ‘as usual’, and that the populist ascent produces a greater impact on the political system as a vehicle for protest than it does on institutions once in power. We analyze the three examples of populism represented by the 5 Star Movement, Podemos and La République En March in order to examine the transformations produced by their successes in their relative political systems and their various effects on institutions once in government.",,,Comparative European Politics,,,2023-03-18,2023,2023-03-18,,,,1-26,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Campolongo, Francesco; Scanni, Francesco Maria","Campolongo, Francesco (University of Calabria, Political and Social Science Department, Via Pietro Bucci, 87036, Arcavacata, Rende, CS, Italy); Scanni, Francesco Maria (University of Calabria, Political and Social Science Department, Via Pietro Bucci, 87036, Arcavacata, Rende, CS, Italy; University of Teramo, Political Science Department, Teramo, Italy)","Campolongo, Francesco (University of Calabria)","Campolongo, Francesco (University of Calabria); Scanni, Francesco Maria (University of Calabria; University of Teramo)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/s41295-022-00322-4.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156323353,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration; 4408 Political Science,

Three Figures of Teaching During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In this paper, I focus on teachers’ lived experiences during the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, I explore the emotional impact the abrupt shift to online teaching had on teachers’ work and life throughout the various phases of the lockdown. I develop my argument by analyzing teachers’ everyday work, using a qualitative approach, and constructing a small-scale empirical study. Philosophically, my attempt is phenomenologically developed and is framed by Heidegger’s and Arendt’s thoughts. Methodologically, my attempt falls within an emerging research horizon that combines educational philosophy with empirical research. Drawing from research data, I argue that teachers’ experience bears witness to a deep modification of the schooling space-time, namely, the horizon in which the very perception of students, themselves, and teaching arise. In the case of teachers experiencing discomfort, fear, and even angst, the totality of their gestures and emotions was, as it were, swallowed by this unknown and disquieting horizon; teachers in distress were experiencing the collapse of any projecting without being freed by projecting itself. In the case of teachers experiencing feelings of fulfillment and even joy, a different horizon was allowed to emerge. Such a different space-time, rather than producing a sense of distance and alienation, created a new intimacy and nearness, which allows for a different attitude toward the topics and the educational community. Students became more sensitive, susceptible to transformation, and open to what was being said. At the same time, relationships were caught in a new web of meanings that transcended them, thus giving birth to an educational experience in its own right. I conclude with some remarks about the building of the educational community.",,Open access funding provided by Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.,Studies in Philosophy and Education,,,2023-03-18,2023,2023-03-18,,,,1-21,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"d’Agnese, Vasco","d’Agnese, Vasco (Department of Psychology, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Viale Ellittico 31, 81100, Caserta, Italy)","d’Agnese, Vasco (University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"")","d’Agnese, Vasco (University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"")",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11217-023-09873-9.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156323006,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,

In Sweden, compulsory care in the social-services system is disputed, not least for the forceful measures that facility personnel have at their disposal to control children in certain conflict situations. The general aim of this article is to examine how the increased emphasis in Sweden on children’s rights is promoting resilience for children and youth in youth compulsory secure-care settings. A more general question is whether the child-rights discourse leads in practice to increased resilience for children and youth in this setting, or even in general. The empirical material shows that children and young people’s perceptions of care and treatment are strongly linked to their interactions with staff and how the staff use restrictive measures. Applying Martha Fineman’s vulnerability theory in this context means that achieving resilience demands an analysis of the institutional settings in which children and young persons live their day-to-day lives, including their relationships in this setting. Comparing the legal possibilities of physical constraint with interviews of children and personnel reveals that relevant legislative frameworks and children’s-rights discourse should serve as a protection mechanism for children and youths, but in real life, these seem to have limited effect.","This study is funded by the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare, STYA-2019/0004.

On the brink of these turbulent times, we concluded a larger survey study describing first grade literacy instruction in February 2020. Having documented a year of pre-pandemic literacy instruction, we then reached out to the same participants to report on their experiences teaching first grade during the 2020–2021 academic year impacted by COVID-19. In this exploratory study we surveyed first grade teachers (n = 36) to better understand the context, the amount of time allocated, and the materials and resources used by teachers for and during literacy instruction and how these variables differed before and during the COVID 19 pandemic. Our data indicated teachers had increased responsibility as they had reduced access to collaborative planning (t35 = − 2.092, p = .004, d = − 0.507), and the support of paraprofessionals (t35 = − 2.256, p = .030, d = 0.457). This increase in responsibility was amplified by the challenges of virtual and hybrid instruction, and the changes in instructional formats experienced by teachers. Concurrently, students experienced less instructional time (Z35 = − 3.704, p < .001, r = − 0.437), particularly in the areas of writing, vocabulary, and fluency.

The recent turn towards embodied, affective and sensory literacies, stimulated our interest in multisensory picturebooks that engage all children’s senses, including the sense of smell (olfaction). Olfactory children’s picturebooks demand new forms of literary conversations, which capitalise on unique properties of odours and integrate these with stories. Drawing on a systematic search of children’s picturebooks about, and with, smell, in paper-based and digital formats, we identified three principal ways in which olfaction is currently embedded in children’s picturebooks: 1, as an add-on to depiction of objects (including foods, plants) and places, 2, as a device to introduce humour into a story, and 3, as an engagement tool for children’s active participation in the story. We mobilise Sipe’s (2008) concept of seven constituting elements in children’s picturebooks to describe how current olfactory picturebooks apply the elements in their design and make recommendations for future development of children’s olfactory picturebooks. Reflecting on the generative potential of literary theories and olfactory power to stimulate children’s non-linguistic embodied interactions with picturebooks, we propose some extensions to the current olfactory picturebook landscape.",,"Open access funding provided by University of Stavanger & Stavanger University Hospital.

Prevalence odds ratio of suicide behaviors among adolescents with obesity (vs. adolescents with no obesity) for each survey year and time trends using National Cancer Institute Joinpoint regression analysis was calculated. For each year post-baseline, there was a significant increase of prevalence odds ratio of 1.4 (1.2–1.6)–1.6 (1.3–2.0) for suicide ideation, 1.3 (1.1–1.7) –1.7 (1.4–2.0) for plan, and 1.3 (1.0–1.7) –1.9 (1.5–2.4) for an attempt, except for the 2013 survey for attempt (1.19 [0.9–1.6]). Significant positive trends were found from1999 to 2019 for ideation and plan, with biannual %-changes of + 0.92 and + 1.22%, respectively.

Since non-invasive prenatal tests (NIPTs) were first introduced, keeping pace with complexity constitutes an ongoing task for medical societies, politics, and practice. NIPTs analyse the chromosomes of the fetus from a small blood sample. Initially, NIPTs were targeted at detecting trisomy 21 (Down syndrome): meanwhile there are sequencing techniques capable of analysing the entire genome of the unborn child. These yield findings of unclear relevance for the child’s future life, resulting in new responsibility structures and dilemmas for the parents-to-be.The industry’s marketing strategies overemphasize the benefits of the tests while disregarding their consequences. This paper chooses the opposite path: starting with the underestimated consequences, it focuses on adverse developments and downsides. Disparities, paradoxes, and risks associated with NIPTs are illustrated, ethical conflicts described. Indications that new technologies developed to solve problems create new ones are examined. In the sense of critical thinking, seemingly robust knowledge is scrutinized for uncertainties and ambiguities. It analyses how the interplay between genetic knowledge and social discourse results in new dimensions of responsibility not only for parents-to-be, but also for decision-makers, authorities, and professional societies, illustrated by a review of different national policies and implementation programmes. As shown by the new NIPT policy in Norway, the consequences can be startling.

While scholars have often been interested in the impact of past federal policy on current levels of economic development among American Indian tribes, none have explicitly examined the influence of federal assimilation policy on long-run economic development. In this paper, I take advantage of tribal-level variation in the application of federal policies to estimate the effect of assimilation on long-run economic performance. To quantify the impact of such policies, I introduce a novel measure of cultural assimilation: the prevalence of traditional indigenous names relative to common American first names. To calculate the distribution of name types, I have gathered the names and locations for all American Indians enumerated in the 1900 United States census. After classifying each name, I calculated the reservation-specific share of non-indigenous names. I estimate the relationship between cultural assimilation in 1900 and per capita income from 1970 through 2020. I find that historical levels of assimilation are consistently associated with higher levels of per capita income in all census years. The results are robust to the inclusion of a variety of cultural and institutional controls and regional fixed effects.","I am thankful for helpful comments and suggestions from Terry Anderson, Christian l, Donn Feir, Dustin Frye, Maggie Jones, Pasha Mahdavi, Ilia Murtazashvili, Dominic Parker, and participants at Public Choice Workshop on The Political Economy of American Indian Policy at the Hoover Institution, the World Congress of Cliometrics, the Economic History Society Annual Conference, the University of Michigan Economic History Seminar, and the Social Science History Association Annual Conference.",,Public Choice,,,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,,,1-18,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Miller, Melinda C.","Miller, Melinda C.

Once historically widespread, herbaceous marsh and forested tidal freshwater wetlands especially are now highly degraded worldwide. Additionally, quantitative assessments of hydrology and material exchange from these systems are lacking compared to lotic and estuarine (saltmarsh) habitats. Here we investigate macroinvertebrate and energy export from tidal marsh and forested wetlands and consider potential benefits from this ecological process to endangered Pacific salmon in a large tidal freshwater system, the Columbia River (USA). Macroinvertebrate (salmon prey) concentration, water velocity, and discharge were measured at several wetland habitat types (forested swamp, emergent marsh, and restored marsh). We used these data to compute prey flux and transport metrics. Then, applying literature values to calculate prey energy equivalents and juvenile salmon metabolic requirements, we estimated the potential energy subsidy available to juvenile salmon. Numerically, larval stages of aquatic insects were the predominant type of prey exported from the wetlands, with Diptera chironomid fly abundance exceeding other groups. Energetically, however, non-chironomid dipterans and hemipteran prey comprised most of energy transport due to their higher energetic content (energy density × mean weight). We determined the prey energy transported from the sampled tidal channels was sufficient to meet energetic needs of tens to thousands of juvenile salmon per day, depending on prey production and hydrography. The prey taxonomic composition differed among organisms exiting forested swamp, emergent marsh, and restored marsh habitats with corresponding differences in energy transport, but all habitat types supported similar numbers of juvenile salmon. We conclude that macroinvertebrate prey exported from varied tidal freshwater wetlands likely provide significant benefits to juvenile salmon over a larger ecological footprint than the wetland area would suggest.","This paper is a product of the Action Effectiveness Monitoring and Research (AMER) study, a joint effort by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory coordinated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

500,pub.1156292017,10.1073/pnas.2216440120,36930599,,Modulation of potassium conductances optimizes fidelity of auditory information,"Potassium channels in auditory neurons are rapidly modified by changes in the auditory environment. In response to elevated auditory stimulation, short-term mechanisms such as protein phosphorylation and longer-term mechanisms such as accelerated channel synthesis increase the amplitude of currents that promote high-frequency firing. It has been suggested that this allows neurons to fire at high rates in response to high sound levels. We have carried out simple simulations of the response to postsynaptic neurons to patterns of neurotransmitter release triggered by auditory stimuli. These demonstrate that the amplitudes of potassium currents required for optimal encoding of a low-amplitude auditory signal differ from those for louder sounds. Specifically, the cross-correlation of the output of a neuron with an auditory stimulus is improved by increasing potassium currents as sound amplitude increases. Temporal fidelity for low-frequency stimuli is improved by increasing potassium currents that activate at negative potentials, while that for high-frequency stimuli requires increases in currents that activate at positive membrane potentials. These effects are independent of the firing rate. Moreover, levels of potassium currents that maximize the fidelity of the output of an ensemble of neurons differ from those that maximize fidelity for a single neuron. This suggests that the modulatory mechanisms must coordinate channel activity in groups of neurons or an entire nucleus. The simulations provide an explanation for the modulation of the intrinsic excitability of auditory brainstem neurons by changes in environmental sound levels, and the results may extend to information processing in other neural systems.",This work was supported by NIH grant DC01919 to L.K.K.,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,Action Potentials; Membrane Potentials; Potassium Channels; Phosphorylation; Potassium; Auditory Pathways,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,2023-03-21,120,12,e2216440120,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Kaczmarek, Leonard K.","Kaczmarek, Leonard K.

Development and preliminary validation of the Australia & New Zealand Musculoskeletal (ANZMUSC) Clinical Trials Network Research Question Importance Tool (ANZMUSC-RQIT),"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: High quality clinical research that addresses important questions requires significant resources. In resource-constrained environments, projects will therefore need to be prioritized. The Australia and New Zealand Musculoskeletal (ANZMUSC) Clinical Trials Network aimed to develop a stakeholder-based, transparent, easily implementable tool that provides a score for the 'importance' of a research question which could be used to rank research projects in order of importance.
METHODS: Using a mixed-methods, multi-stage approach that included a Delphi survey, consensus workshop, inter-rater reliability testing, validity testing and calibration using a discrete-choice methodology, the Research Question Importance Tool (ANZMUSC-RQIT) was developed. The tool incorporated broad stakeholder opinion, including consumers, at each stage and is designed for scoring by committee consensus.
RESULTS: The ANZMUSC-RQIT tool consists of 5 dimensions (compared to 6 dimensions for an earlier version of RQIT): (1) extent of stakeholder consensus, (2) social burden of health condition, (3) patient burden of health condition, (4) anticipated effectiveness of proposed intervention, and (5) extent to which health equity is addressed by the research. Each dimension is assessed by defining ordered levels of a relevant attribute and by assigning a score to each level. The scores for the dimensions are then summed to obtain an overall ANZMUSC-RQIT score, which represents the importance of the research question. The result is a score on an interval scale with an arbitrary unit, ranging from 0 (minimal importance) to 1000. The ANZMUSC-RQIT dimensions can be reliably ordered by committee consensus (ICC 0.73-0.93) and the overall score is positively associated with citation count (standardised regression coefficient 0.33, p<0.001) and journal impact factor group (OR 6.78, 95% CI 3.17 to 14.50 for 3rd tertile compared to 1st tertile of ANZMUSC-RQIT scores) for 200 published musculoskeletal clinical trials.
CONCLUSION: We propose that the ANZMUSC-RQIT is a useful tool for prioritising the importance of a research question.","We gratefully acknowledge the help of Emeritus Professor Jane Latimer, Helen Ramsay (Executive Officer of ANZMUSC) and Tania Pocock (Health Research Council of New Zealand), Dr Chris Dalton (National Medical Officer BUPA Australia) for participation in the consensus workshop.

These methods are, however, prone to errors arising from undetected particle profiles due to sectioning and limited resolution, known as 'lost caps'. A potential solution developed by Keiding, Jensen, and Ranek in 1972, which we refer to as the Keiding model, accounts for lost caps by quantifying the smallest detectable profile in terms of its limiting 'cap angle' (ϕ), a size-independent measure of a particle's distance from the section surface. However, this simple solution has not been widely adopted nor tested. Rather, model-independent design-based stereological methods, which do not explicitly account for lost caps, have come to the fore. Here, we provide the first experimental validation of the Keiding model by comparing the size and density of particles estimated from 2D projections with direct measurement from 3D EM reconstructions of the same tissue. We applied the Keiding model to estimate the size and density of somata, nuclei and vesicles in the cerebellum of mice and rats, where high packing density can be problematic for design-based methods. Our analysis reveals a Gaussian distribution for ϕ rather than a single value. Nevertheless, curve fits of the Keiding model to the 2D diameter distribution accurately estimate the mean ϕ and 3D diameter distribution. While systematic testing using simulations revealed an upper limit to determining ϕ, our analysis shows that estimated ϕ can be used to determine the 3D particle density from the 2D density under a wide range of conditions, and this method is potentially more accurate than minimum-size-based lost-cap corrections and disector methods. Our results show the Keiding model provides an efficient means of accurately estimating the size and density of particles from 2D projections even under conditions of a high density.","We thank the IST Austria Electron Microscopy Facility for technical support, and Diccon Coyle, Andrea Lőrincz and Zoltan Nusser for their helpful comments and discussions.","Funding for JSR and RAS was from the Wellcome Trust (203048; 224499; https://wellcome.org/).

A regression analysis shows no link between visual metacognition and Autism-Spectrum Quotient scores,"Metacognition -the human ability to recognize correct decisions- is a key cognitive process linked to learning and development. Several recent studies investigated the relationship between metacognition and autism. However, the evidence is still inconsistent. While some studies reported autistic people having lower levels of metacognitive sensitivity, others did not. Leveraging the fact that autistic traits are present in the general population, our study investigated the relationship between visual metacognition and autistic traits in a sample of 360 neurotypical participants. We measured metacognition as the correspondence between confidence and accuracy in a visual two alternative forced choice task. Autistic-traits were assessed through the Autism-spectrum Quotient (AQ) score. A regression analysis revealed no statistically significant association between autistic traits and metacognition or confidence. Furthermore, we found no link between AQ sub-scales and metacognition. We do not find support for the hypothesis that autistic traits are associated with metacognition in the general population.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This study was supported by Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (PICT 2018–03614), Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (PRIMAR-TP 2018–2020), PIP 11220150100787CO, Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBACyT 20020170100330BA) and Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET).

Common indicators like active case numbers may not be sensitive enough in the presence of systemic inefficiencies like insufficient testing or contact tracing. Test positivity rates are sensitive to testing strategies and cannot estimate the extent of undetected cases. Reproductive numbers estimated from logarithms of new incidences are inaccurate in dynamic scenarios and not sensitive enough to capture changes in efficiencies. Systemic fatigue results in lower testing, inefficient tracing and quarantining thereby precipitating the onset of the epidemic wave. We propose a novel indicator for detecting the slippage of test-trace efficiency based on the number of deaths/hospitalizations resulting from known and hitherto unknown infections. This can also be used to forecast an epidemic wave that is advanced or exacerbated due to a drop in efficiency in situations where the testing has come down drastically and contact tracing is virtually nil as is prevalent currently. Using a modified SEIRD epidemic simulator we show that (i) Ratio of deaths/hospitalizations from an undetected infection to total deaths converges to a measure of systemic test-trace inefficiency. (ii) This index forecasts the slippage in efficiency earlier than other known metrics. (iii) Mitigation triggered by this index helps reduce peak active caseload and eventual deaths. Deaths/hospitalizations accurately track the systemic inefficiencies and detect latent cases. Based on these results we make a strong case that administrations use this metric in the ensemble of indicators. Further, hospitals may need to be mandated to distinctly register deaths/hospitalizations due to previously undetected infections. Thus the proposed metric is an ideal indicator of an epidemic wave that poses the least socio-economic cost while keeping the surveillance robust during periods of pandemic fatigue.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Humans; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Pandemics; Quarantine; Contact Tracing,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,18,3,e0283081,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rangayyan, Yashaswini Mandayam; Kidambi, Sriram; Raghavan, Mohan","Rangayyan, Yashaswini Mandayam (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology - Hyderabad, Hyderabad, Telangana, India); Kidambi, Sriram (Department of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, United States of America); Raghavan, Mohan (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology - Hyderabad, Hyderabad, Telangana, India)","Rangayyan, Yashaswini Mandayam (Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad)","Rangayyan, Yashaswini Mandayam (Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad); Kidambi, Sriram (The University of Texas at Dallas); Raghavan, Mohan (Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283081&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156292004,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) posits scaling of biological rates with temperature, but it has had limited application to population dynamic forecasting. Here we use the temperature dependence of the MTE to constrain empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), an equation-free nonlinear machine learning approach for forecasting. By rescaling time with temperature and modeling dynamics on a ""metabolic time step,"" our method (MTE-EDM) improved forecast accuracy in 18 of 19 empirical ectotherm time series (by 19% on average), with the largest gains in more seasonal environments. MTE-EDM assumes that temperature affects only the rate, rather than the form, of population dynamics, and that interacting species have approximately similar temperature dependence. A review of laboratory studies suggests these assumptions are reasonable, at least approximately, though not for all ecological systems. Our approach highlights how to combine modern data-driven forecasting techniques with ecological theory and mechanistic understanding to predict the response of complex ecosystems to temperature variability and trends.","The University of Zurich Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity supported this research.

This is also true for South Africa, where over fifty per cent of pregnancies are reported as unintended, even though contraception is freely available. There is also stagnation in the fertility rate indicators and contraceptive use data, indicating that there may be challenges to accessing contraception. This paper explores the evaluation of access to contraception from community and health care provider perspectives. This qualitative study explored factors affecting the uptake and use of contraception through focus group discussions (n = 14), in-depth interviews (n = 8), and drawings. Participants included male and female community members (n = 103) between 15 and 49 years of age, health care providers (n = 16), and key stakeholder informants (n = 8), with a total number of 127 participants. Thematic content analysis was used to explore the data using NVivo 10. Emergent themes were elucidated and thematically categorised. The results were categorised according to a priori access components. Overall, the results showed that the greatest obstacle to accessing contraception was the accommodation component. This included the effects of integrated care, long waiting times, and limited operational hours-all of which contributed to the discontinuation of contraception. Community members reported being satisfied with the accessibility and affordability components but less satisfied with the availability of trained providers and a variety of contraceptive methods. The accessibility and affordability themes also revealed the important role that individual agency and choice in service provider plays in accessing contraception. Data from the illustrations showed that adolescent males experienced the most geographic barriers. This study illustrated the importance of examining access as a holistic concept and to assess each component's influence on contraceptive uptake and use.",The authors would like to thank all the participants who gave their valuable time to participate in this study.

We included all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between February 1, 2020 and January 21, 2021 and extracted specific anti-COVID-19 therapies (ST) from computerized patient record, as well as patients' demographic characteristics, comorbidities and outcome. The evolution of ST prescriptions during the study period was described and put into perspective with the updates of local recommendations made during the first (V1, from 2/24/2020 to 7/27/2020), and second (V2, from 7/28/2020 to 1/21/2021) epidemic waves.
RESULTS: A total of 607 COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 197 during V1 and 410 during V2. Their mean age was 65 years-old, and they presented frequent comorbidities. In total, 93% of hospitalized patients received ST: anticoagulants (90%), glucocorticoids (39%) mainly during V2 (49% vs 17%, P<0.001), and azithromycin (30%) mainly during V1 (71% vs 10%, P<0.001). Lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine were prescribed to 17 and 7 inpatients, respectively, and only during V1. Remdesivir was never administered. A total of 22 inpatients were enrolled into clinical trials.
CONCLUSIONS: The effective dissemination of evidence-based and concerted recommendations seems to have allowed an optimized management of COVID-19 drug therapies in the context of this emerging infection with rapidly evolving therapeutic questions.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Humans; Aged; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19 Drug Treatment; Tertiary Care Centers; Lopinavir; Ritonavir; Hydroxychloroquine; Antiviral Agents,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,18,3,e0283165,All OA; Gold,Article,"Peretti, Matthieu; Rebaudet, Stanislas; Chiche, Laurent; Pegliasco, Hervé; Coquet, Emilie","Peretti, Matthieu (Service de Pharmacie, Hôpital Européen, Marseille, France); Rebaudet, Stanislas (Service d’Infectiologie et de Médecine Interne, Hôpital Européen, Marseille, France; UMR1252 SESSTIM, Aix-Marseille Univ, Inserm, IRD, ISSPAM, Marseille, France); Chiche, Laurent (Service d’Infectiologie et de Médecine Interne, Hôpital Européen, Marseille, France); Pegliasco, Hervé (Service de Pneumologie, Hôpital Européen, Marseille, France); Coquet, Emilie (Service de Pharmacie, Hôpital Européen, Marseille, France)","Chiche, Laurent (Hôpital Européen)","Peretti, Matthieu (Hôpital Européen); Rebaudet, Stanislas (Hôpital Européen); Chiche, Laurent (Hôpital Européen); Pegliasco, Hervé (Hôpital Européen); Coquet, Emilie (Hôpital Européen)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283165&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156292041,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Due to its nationwide reach and mission to improve health, Cooperative Extension (Extension) is poised to be a sustainable DPP delivery system. However, research evaluating DPP implementation in Extension remains scant. Extension professionals delivered the DPP in a single-arm hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation study. Semi-structured interviews with Extension professionals were conducted at three time points. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided interview coding and analysis. Constructs were rated for magnitude and valence and evaluated as facilitators or barriers of RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) outcomes. The program reached 119 participants, was adopted by 92% (n = 12/13) of trained Extension professionals and was implemented according to CDC standards: all programs exceeded the minimum 22-session requirement (26 ± 2 sessions). The program was effective in achieving weight loss (5.0 ± 5.2%) and physical activity (179 ± 122 min/week) goals. At post-intervention, eight professionals (67%) had begun or planned to maintain the intervention within the next 6 months. Several facilitators were identified, including Extension leadership structure, organizational compatibility, and technical assistance calls. Limited time to recruit participants was the primary barrier. Positive RE-AIM outcomes, facilitated by contextual factors, indicate Extension is an effective and sustainable DPP delivery system. Extension and other DPP implementers should plan strategies that promote communication, the program’s evidence-base, recruitment time, and resource access. Researchers should explore DPP implementation in real-world settings to determine overall and setting-specific best practices, promote intervention uptake, and reduce diabetes.","We would like to acknowledge the DPP participants and the Extension professionals who were the subject of this research. Without the incredible dedication of these thirteen outstanding professionals and their commitment to the health and wellbeing of their DPP participants and to the mission of Extension, this research would not be possible.","This work was supported by the University of Georgia Interdisciplinary Seed Grant Program and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under award number UL1TR002378.

Its characterization together with the identification of prognostic factors for a persistent LBP course may trigger the development of personalized interventions. This study aimed to investigate the courses of chronic LBP (CLBP), its cumulative impact, and the indicators for the persistence of pain.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with active CLBP from the EpiDoC, a population-based cohort study of a randomly recruited sample of 10.661 adults with prolonged follow-up, were considered. Pain, disability, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were assessed at three time-points over five years. According to their pain symptoms over time, participants were classified as having a persistent (pain at the baseline and at all the subsequent time-points) or a relapsing pain course (pain at the baseline and no pain at least in one of the subsequent time-points). A mixed ANOVA was used to compare mean differences within and between patients of distinct courses. Prognostic indicators for the persistent LBP course were modulated through logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among the 1.201 adults with active CLBP at baseline, 634 (52.8%) completed the three time-points of data collection: 400 (63.1%) had a persistent and 234 (36.9%) a relapsing course. Statistically significant interactions were found between the group and time on disability (F (2,1258) = 23.779, p<0.001) and HRQoL (F (2,1252) = 82.779, p<0.001). In the adjusted model, the persistent course was associated with the disability level (OR 1.86, CI95% 1.40-2.40, p<0.001), depressive symptoms (OR 1.96, CI95% 1.21-3.18, p = 0.007), female gender (OR 1.90, CI95% 1.26-2.87, p = 0.002) and having a manual job (OR 1.46, CI95% 1.02-2.10, p = 0.040).
CONCLUSION: In the long-term, patients with CLBP may follow a persistent or relapsing course of pain. Being female, presenting depressive symptoms, having a manual job and higher disability at baseline predicts a persistent course of LBP.","The authors’ team wishes to acknowledge the contribution of Professor Doctor Carla Nunes for the conceptualization and formal analysis of the current study.

For mental health research in low-income settings, tele-follow-up raises unique safety concerns due to the potential of identifying suicide risk in participants who cannot be immediately referred to in-person care. We developed and iteratively adapted a telephone-delivered protocol designed to follow a positive suicide risk assessment (SRA) screening. We describe the development and implementation of this SRA protocol during follow-up of a cohort of adults with depression in Malawi enrolled in the Sub-Saharan Africa Regional Partnership for Mental Health Capacity Building (SHARP) randomized control trial during the COVID-19 era. We assess protocol feasibility and performance, describe challenges and lessons learned during protocol development, and discuss how this protocol may function as a model for use in other settings. Transition from in-person to telephone SRAs was feasible and identified participants with suicidal ideation (SI). Follow-up protocol monitoring indicated a 100% resolution rate of SI in cases following the SRA during this period, indicating that this was an effective strategy for monitoring SI virtually. Over 2% of participants monitored by phone screened positive for SI in the first six months of protocol implementation. Most were passive risk (73%). There were no suicides or suicide attempts during the study period. Barriers to implementation included use of a contact person for participants without personal phones, intermittent network problems, and pre-paid phone plans delaying follow-up. Delays in follow-up due to challenges with reaching contact persons, intermittent network problems, and pre-paid phone plans should be considered in future adaptations. Future directions include validation studies for use of this protocol in its existing context. This protocol was successful at identifying suicide risk levels and providing research assistants and participants with structured follow-up and referral plans. The protocol can serve as a model for virtual SRA development and is currently being adapted for use in other contexts.",,"This study received funding from the National Institute of Mental Health (PI: Brian W.

Dysregulated turnover of collagen type III is associated with development of kidney fibrosis. We investigated whether a degradation product of collagen type III (C3M) was a risk marker for progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality during follow up in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and microalbuminuria. Moreover, we investigated whether C3M was correlated with markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction at baseline.
METHODS: C3M was measured in serum (sC3M) and urine (uC3M) in 200 participants with T2D and microalbuminuria included in an observational, prospective study at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen in Denmark from 2007-2008. Baseline measurements included 12 markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. The endpoints were CVD, mortality, and CKD progression (>30% decline in eGFR).
RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 59 (9) years, eGFR 90 (17) ml/min/1.73m2 and median (IQR) urine albumin excretion rate 102 (39-229) mg/24-h. At baseline all markers for inflammation were positively correlated with sC3M (p≤0.034). Some, but not all, markers for endothelial dysfunction were correlated with C3M. Median follow-up ranged from 4.9 to 6.3 years. Higher sC3M was associated with CKD progression (with mortality as competing risk) with a hazard ratio (per doubling) of 2.98 (95% CI: 1.41-6.26; p = 0.004) adjusted for traditional risk factors. uC3M was not associated with CKD progression. Neither sC3M or uC3M were associated with risk of CVD or mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher sC3M was a risk factor for chronic kidney disease progression and was correlated with markers of inflammation.","Authors want to thank all participants and acknowledge the work of lab technicians Ulla M.

500,pub.1156300306,10.1159/000528484,36934716,,The Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdowns on Alcohol Consumption and Tobacco Smoking Behaviour in South Africa: A National Survey.,"INTRODUCTION: During the first phase of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic lockdowns in South Africa (SA), both alcohol and tobacco were considered non-essential goods and their sales were initially prohibited and further restricted to certain days and timeframes. This study investigates self-reported changes in alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking behaviour in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in SA.
METHODS: A cross-sectional national survey was conducted in October 2021 (before the Omicron wave 4 and while SA was in low-level lockdown) among 3,402 nationally representative respondents (weighted to 39,640,674) aged 18 years and older. Alcohol consumption and tobacco use were assessed from the beginning of the lockdown towards the end of March 2020 until October 2021 using the WHO-AUDIT and the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) Global Adult Tobacco Survey questionnaires, respectively.
RESULTS: Among those that drank alcohol (33.2%), 31.4% were classified as having a drinking problem that could be hazardous or harmful and 18.9% had severe alcohol use disorder during the COVID-19 lockdowns. Twenty-two per cent (22.0%) of those that reported alcohol consumption reported that the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns changed their alcohol consumption habits, with 38.1% reporting a decreased intake or quitting altogether. Among the one in five respondents (19.2%) who had ever smoked, most reported smoking at the time of the survey (82.6%) with many classified as light smokers (87.8%; ≤10 cigarettes/day). Almost a third (27.2%) of those smoking reported that the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns had changed their use of tobacco products or vaping, with 60.0% reporting a reduction/quitting tobacco use. Given that sales were restricted this indicates that people could still get hold of tobacco products. Heavy smoking was associated with older age (p = 0.02), those classified as wealthy (p < 0.001), those who started or increased tobacco smoking during the pandemic lockdowns (p = 0.01) and residential provinces (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Given restrictions on the sale of alcohol and tobacco in SA between 27 March and August 17, 2020, during the pandemic, respondents reported an overall decline in alcohol consumption and tobacco use which might suggest that the regulatory restrictive strategies on sales had some effect but may be inadequate, especially during times where individuals are likely to experience high-stress levels. These changes in alcohol consumption and tobacco use were different from what was reported in several European countries, possibly due to differences in the restrictions imposed in SA when compared to these European countries.",,,European Addiction Research,,,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,2023-03-17,,,1-14,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Mapanga, Witness; Craig, Ashleigh; Mtintsilana, Asanda; Dlamini, Siphiwe N; Du Toit, Justin; Ware, Lisa J; Norris, Shane A","Mapanga, Witness (SAMRC/Wits Developmental Pathways to Health Research Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of the Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.; Strengthening Oncology Services Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Craig, Ashleigh (SAMRC/Wits Developmental Pathways to Health Research Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of the Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Mtintsilana, Asanda (SAMRC/Wits Developmental Pathways to Health Research Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of the Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Dlamini, Siphiwe N (SAMRC/Wits Developmental Pathways to Health Research Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of the Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Du Toit, Justin (DSI-NRF Centre of Excellence in Human Development, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Ware, Lisa J (DSI-NRF Centre of Excellence in Human Development, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Norris, Shane A (SAMRC/Wits Developmental Pathways to Health Research Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of the Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.; DSI-NRF Centre of Excellence in Human Development, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.; Global Health Research Institute, School of Human Development and Health, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.)",,"Mapanga, Witness (University of the Witwatersrand; University of the Witwatersrand); Craig, Ashleigh (University of the Witwatersrand); Mtintsilana, Asanda (University of the Witwatersrand); Dlamini, Siphiwe N (University of the Witwatersrand); Du Toit, Justin (University of the Witwatersrand); Ware, Lisa J (University of the Witwatersrand); Norris, Shane A (University of the Witwatersrand; University of the Witwatersrand; University of Southampton)",0,0,,,https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/528484,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156300306,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

A strontium and oxygen isotope perspective on two archaeological sites,"European Bronze Age societies are generally characterised by increased mobility and the application of isotopic methods to archaeology has allowed the rate and range of human travels to be quantified. However, little is known about the mobility of the people inhabiting East-Central Europe in the late Early and Middle Bronze Age (1950-1250 BC) whose primary subsistence strategy was herding supported by crop cultivation. This paper presents the results of strontium (87Sr/86Sr) and oxygen (δ18O) isotope analyses in the enamel of people buried in collective graves at the cemeteries in Gustorzyn and Żerniki Górne. These sites are located in Kujawy and the Nida Basin, a lowland and an upland region with clearly different environmental conditions, respectively. Both sites are classified as belonging to the Trzciniec cultural circle and were used between 16th and 13th centuries BC. Among the 34 examined individuals only an adult female from Gustorzyn can be assessed as non-local based on both 87Sr/86Sr and δ18O signatures in her first molar. This may indicate the practice of exogamy in the studied population but more generally corresponds with the hypothesis of limited mobility within these societies, as has previously been inferred from archaeological evidence, anthropological analysis, and stable isotope-based diet reconstruction. New and existing data evaluated in this paper show that the 87Sr/86Sr variability in the natural environment of both regions is relatively high, allowing the tracking of short-range human mobility. A series of oxygen isotope analyses (conducted for all but one individuals studied with strontium isotopes) indicates that δ18O ratios measured in phosphate are in agreement with the predicted modern oxygen isotope precipitation values, and that this method is useful in detecting travels over larger distances. The challenges of using both 87Sr/86Sr and δ18O isotopic systems in provenance studies in the glacial landscapes of temperate Europe are also discussed.",,"This research was funded by the Polish National Science Centre (Narodowe Centrum Nauki; www.ncn.gov.pl) grants (2015/17/B/HS3/00114 and 2018/31/B/HS3/01326) for PM, and by the Faculty of Archaeology of the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań (Wydzial Archeologii Uniwersytetu im.

In this paper, we test the role of psychological and cognitive mechanisms in explaining this effect. We assessed the mediating role of executive function, self-control, and time preferences.
METHODS: We used data from the Sustainable Transformation of Youth in Liberia, a community-based randomized controlled trial of criminally engaged men. The men were randomized into: Group-1: control (n = 237); and Group-2: CBT+UCT (n = 207). ASB was measured 12-13 months after the interventions were completed, and the following mediators were assessed 2-5 weeks later: (i) self-control, (ii) time preferences and (iii) executive functions. We estimated the natural direct effect (NDE) and the natural indirect effect (NIE) of the intervention over ASB.
RESULTS: Self-control, time preferences and a weighted index of all three mediators were associated with ASB scores, but the intervention influenced time preferences only [B = 0.09 95%CI (0.03; 0.15)]. There was no evidence that the effect of the intervention on ASB was mediated by self-control [BNIE = 0.007 95%CI (-0.01; 0.02)], time preferences [BNIE = -0.02 95%CI (-0.05; 0.01)], executive functions [BNIE = 0.002 95%CI (-0.002; 0.006)] or the weighted index of the mediators [BNIE = -0.0005 95%CI (-0.03; 0.02)].
CONCLUSIONS: UCT and CBT lead to improvements in ASB, even in the absence of mediation via psychological and cognitive functions. Findings suggest that the causal mechanisms may involve non-psychological pathways.",,"This study is an output of the CHANCES-6 study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM, n = 64) or insulin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, n = 36) completed three daily 'check-ins' (morning, afternoon and evening) via the Hypo-METRICs app across 10 weeks, to respond to 29 unique questions about their subjective daily functioning. Questions addressed sleep quality, energy level, mood, affect, cognitive functioning, fear of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, social functioning, and work/productivity. Completion rates, structural validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability were explored. App responses were correlated with validated person-reported outcome measures to investigate convergent (rs>±0.3) and divergent (rs<±0.3) validity.
RESULTS: Participants' mean±SD age was 54±16 years, diabetes duration was 23±13 years, and most recent HbA1c was 56.6±9.8 mmol/mol. Participants submitted mean±SD 191±16 out of 210 possible 'check-ins' (91%). Structural validity was confirmed with multi-level confirmatory factor analysis showing good model fit on the adjusted model (Comparative Fit Index >0.95, Root-Mean-Square Error of Approximation <0.06, Standardized Root-Mean-square Residual<0.08). Scales had satisfactory internal consistency (all ω≥0.5), and high test-retest reliability (rs≥0.7). Convergent and divergent validity were demonstrated for most scales.
CONCLUSION: High completion rates and satisfactory psychometric properties demonstrated that the Hypo-METRICS app is acceptable to adults with T1DM and T2DM, and a reliable and valid tool to explore the daily impact of hypoglycemia.","The authors cordially thank the people with diabetes who participated in the Hypo-METRICS study for their support, as well as the site personnel involved in participant recruitment on each of the clinical centres.

The current study investigated sexual attitudes in the German population with regard to sociodemographic and sociocultural factors. Data originated from the German Health and Sexuality Survey (GeSiD; N = 4,955) carried out from October 2018 to September 2019. Computer-assisted face to face interviews were conducted with a large self-administered component due to the sensitive topics of the survey. Public acceptance towards several aspects of sexual behavior (extramarital sex, abortion, same sex sexual activities, sex work, promiscuity, sex without love) was investigated. Age, gender, education, religious aspects and migration background were introduced as predictors into logistic regression analyses. Overall, respondents rather rejected promiscuity (61%) and extramarital sex (81%) and rather supported same sex sexual activities (63-70%). Male respondents more likely rejected same sex sexual activities and abortion. Higher education was associated with more acceptance towards the sexual behaviors whereas first generation migrants, Muslim faith and religious devoutness were associated with less acceptance. Results indicate that gender is relevant in terms of sexual attitudes with male respondents tending to have more traditional and heteronormative gender role values. Furthermore, education, culture and religion play an important role concerning the liberality towards sexual behaviors. Acculturation processes of second generation migrants may lead to an adaptation of values. Comprehensive and culturally sensitive sex education may focus on differences concerning sexuality-related norms and values.",We would like to thank all participants who took part in the study.,"This work was supported by the German Federal Center for Health Education under Grant [number Z2/25.5.2.1./18].

G. Oliver et al., Trends Biotech. 16, 373-378 (1998)]. As the field rapidly advances, it is important to take stock of the progress which has been made to best inform the disciplines future. While a medical-centric perspective on metabolomics has recently been published [M. Giera et al., Cell Metab. 34, 21-34 (2022)], this largely ignores the pioneering contributions made by the plant and microbial science communities. In this perspective, we provide a contemporary overview of all fields in which metabolomics is employed with particular emphasis on both methodological and application breakthroughs made in plant and microbial sciences that have shaped this evolving research discipline from the very early days of its establishment. This will not cover all types of metabolomics assays currently employed but will focus mainly on those utilizing mass spectrometry-based measurements since they are currently by far the most prominent. Having established the historical context of metabolomics, we will address the key challenges currently facing metabolomics and offer potential approaches by which these can be faced. Most salient among these is the fact that the vast majority of mass features are as yet not annotated with high confidence; what we may refer to as definitive identification. We discuss the potential of both standard compound libraries and artificial intelligence technologies to address this challenge and the use of natural variance-based approaches such as genome-wide association studies in attempt to assign specific functions to the myriad of structurally similar and complex specialized metabolites. We conclude by stating our contention that as these challenges are epic and that they will need far greater cooperative efforts from biologists, chemists, and computer scientists with an interest in all kingdoms of life than have been made to date. Ultimately, a better linkage of metabolome and genome data will likely also be needed particularly considering the Earth BioGenome Project.","We gratefully acknowledge Saleh Alseekh and Luis-Alejandro De-Haro for discussions and help with the illustrations.

Studies have shown that one of the main factors affecting the cyclical growth of the cashmere is the photoperiod, however, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Inner Mongolia Arbas cashmere goat was used to reveal the mRNA-microRNA regulatory mechanisms of cashmere growth in different photoperiod. Skin samples from cashmere goats under light control (short photoperiod) and normal conditions (long photoperiod) were collected. Sequencing was performed after RNA extraction. The differentially expressed miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were successfully constructed. We found 56 significantly differentially expressed known mRNAs (P<0.01) and 14 microRNAs (P<0.05). The association analysis of the microRNAs and mRNAs showed that two differentially expressed miRNAs might be targeted by six differentially expressed genes. Targeting relationships of these genes and miRNAs are revealed and verified. In all, the light control technology provides a new way to promote cashmere growth. Our results provide some references in the cashmere growth and development.","L.B. and Z.R.Y. designed and performed the experiments, analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript, W.T. applied the Transcriptional Profiling, M.Y.J., G.Y.L., W.Y.H. and H.B. assisted with experimental design and helped with sample collection and processing. helped with writing.

In July 2020, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) expanded its recommendation for hepatitis A vaccination to include all PWH aged ≥1 year. We used a decision analytic model to estimate the value of vaccinating a cohort of adult PWH aged ≥20 years with diagnosed HIV in the United States using a limited societal perspective. The model compared 3 scenarios over an analytic horizon of 1 year: no vaccination, current vaccine coverage, and full vaccination. We incorporated the direct medical costs and nonmedical costs (i.e., public health costs and productivity loss). We estimated the total number of infections averted, cost to vaccinate, and incremental cost per case averted. Full implementation of the ACIP recommendation resulted in 775 to 812 fewer adult cases of hepatitis A in 1 year compared with the observed vaccination coverage. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the full vaccination scenario was $48,000 for the 2-dose single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine and $130,000 for the 3-dose combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine per case averted, compared with the observed vaccination scenario. Depending on type of vaccine, full hepatitis A vaccination of PWH could lead to ≥80% reduction in the number of cases and $48,000 to $130,000 in additional cost per case averted. Data on hepatitis A health outcomes and costs specific to PWH are needed to better understand the longer-term costs and benefits of the 2020 ACIP recommendation.",,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Adult; Humans; United States; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Hepatitis A; Vaccination; Hepatitis A Vaccines; HIV Infections,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,18,3,e0282972,All OA; Gold,Article,"Abimbola, Taiwo O.; Van Handel, Michelle; Tie, Yunfeng; Ouyang, Lijing; Nelson, Noele; Weiser, John","Abimbola, Taiwo O.

Non-treated PLH show increased levels of inflammation and biomarkers of vascular activation, and arterial stiffness as a prognostic cardiovascular disease risk factor. We investigated the effect of one year of ART on treatment-naïve HIV(+) individuals on arterial stiffness and inflammatory and vascular cytokines.
METHODS: We cross-sectionally compared aortic stiffness via tonometry, inflammatory, and vascular serum cytokines on treatment-naïve (n = 20) and HIV (-) (n = 9) matched by age, sex, metabolic profile, and Framingham score. We subsequently followed young, treatment-naïve individuals after 1-year of ART and compared aortic stiffness, metabolic profile, and inflammatory and vascular serum biomarkers to baseline. Inflammatory biomarkers included: hs-CRP, D-Dimer, SAA, sCD163s, MCP-1, IL-8, IL-18, MRP8/14. Vascular cytokines included: myoglobin, NGAL, MPO, Cystatin C, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MMP9.
RESULTS: Treatment-naïve individuals were 34.8 years old, mostly males (95%), and with high smoking prevalence (70%). Baseline T CD4+ was 512±324 cells/mcL. cfPWV was similar between HIV(-) and treatment-naïve (6.8 vs 7.3 m/s; p = 0.16) but significantly decreased after ART (-0.52 m/s; 95% CI -0.87 to -0.16; p0.006). Almost all the determined cytokines were significantly higher compared to controls, except for MCP-1, myoglobin, NGAL, cystatin C, and MMP-9. At follow-up, only total cholesterol and triglycerides increased and all inflammatory cytokines significantly decreased. Regarding vascular cytokines, MPO, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 showed a reduction. D-Dimer tended to decrease (p = 0.06) and hs-CRP did not show a significant reduction (p = 0.17).
CONCLUSION: One year of ART had a positive effect on reducing inflammatory and vascular cytokines and arterial stiffness.","This article is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Silvia G.

These scaling relations illuminate the underlying physics, and can provide observational tools for estimating masses and distances. Machine learning can provide a fast and systematic way to search for new scaling relations (or for simple extensions to existing relations) in abstract high-dimensional parameter spaces. We use a machine learning tool called symbolic regression (SR), which models patterns in a dataset in the form of analytic equations. We focus on the Sunyaev-Zeldovich flux-cluster mass relation (YSZ - M), the scatter in which affects inference of cosmological parameters from cluster abundance data. Using SR on the data from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, we find a new proxy for cluster mass which combines YSZ and concentration of ionized gas (cgas): M ∝ Yconc3/5 ≡ YSZ3/5(1 - A cgas). Yconc reduces the scatter in the predicted M by ∼20 - 30% for large clusters (M ≳ 1014 h-1 M⊙), as compared to using just YSZ. We show that the dependence on cgas is linked to cores of clusters exhibiting larger scatter than their outskirts. Finally, we test Yconc on clusters from CAMELS simulations and show that Yconc is robust against variations in cosmology, subgrid physics, and cosmic variance. Our results and methodology can be useful for accurate multiwavelength cluster mass estimation from upcoming CMB and X-ray surveys like ACT, SO, eROSITA and CMB-S4.","First of all, we especially thank the anonymous referees for their critical comments as well as various useful suggestions on the manuscript.

Activities associated with non-renewable energy derived from oil and natural gas extraction have substantially increased on grasslands. The cumulative disturbance generated by natural gas development creates a network of non-linear (e.g., bare ground and exotic plant species) and linear (e.g., roads, trails, pipelines) features that may degrade habitat quality for grassland species. We quantified grassland songbird abundance in two areas of southwestern Saskatchewan, Canada, to determine whether variation in abundance 1) depended on the type and amount of disturbance at two spatial extents, and 2) was more affected by the cumulative impacts of natural gas development than any single type of disturbance. We found that specific types of disturbances impacted the abundance of most species to varying degrees. The cover of different types of linear disturbance had the strongest effect on the most species. Natural gas disturbance within 450 m of point counts was more influential than disturbance within 200 m for nearly all species in both areas. Only Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) abundance was most strongly influenced by the cumulative amount of disturbance with abundance decreasing with increased disturbance. Overall, we detected few consistent patterns among species, or within species between our two study areas. Our results indicated that the impact of natural gas infrastructure can extend beyond the local influences associated with well sites and that relatively small amounts of disturbance (<2%) may impact grassland songbird abundance. We recommend that researchers use caution when studying well-density effects or combining individual types of disturbance without understanding the separate effects each type of disturbance has on the species or community of interest. Not doing so may lead to investing resources into management practices that do not have the greatest possible benefit for grassland songbirds.","We thank D. Sawatzky, R. Dudrange, S. Feagan, R.

The aim of this study was to investigate associations between psychosocial resources and sex on the development of frequent pain in a general population sample, and to deepen the knowledge about sex and gender patterns.
METHODS: A sample from the Swedish Health Assets Project, a longitudinal cohort study, included self-reported data from 2263 participants, 53% women, with no frequent pain at baseline. The outcome variable was frequent pain at 18-months follow-up. Psychosocial resources studied were general self-efficacy, instrumental and emotional social support. Log binomial regressions in a generalised linear model were used to calculate risk ratios (RRs), comparing all combinations of men with high psychosocial resources, men with low psychosocial resources, women with high psychosocial resources and women with low psychosocial resources.
RESULTS: Women with low psychosocial resources had higher risk of frequent pain at follow-up compared to men with high resources: general self-efficacy RR 1.82, instrumental social support RR 2.33 and emotional social support RR 1.94. Instrumental social support was the most important protective resource for women, emotional social support was the most important one for men. Results were discussed in terms of gender norms.
CONCLUSIONS: The psychosocial resources general self-efficacy, instrumental and emotional support predicted the risk of developing frequent pain differently among and between men and women in a general population sample. The results showed the importance of studying sex and gender differences in psychological and not least social predictors for pain.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Male; Humans; Female; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Cohort Studies; Chronic Pain; Self Report; Social Support,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,18,3,e0283222,All OA; Gold,Article,"Samulowitz, Anke; Haukenes, Inger; Grimby-Ekman, Anna; Bergman, Stefan; Hensing, Gunnel","Samulowitz, Anke (School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden); Haukenes, Inger (Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway; Research Unit for General Practice, NORCE Norwegian Research Centre, Bergen, Norway); Grimby-Ekman, Anna (School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden); Bergman, Stefan (School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; Spenshult Research and Development Centre, Halmstad, Sweden); Hensing, Gunnel (School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden)","Samulowitz, Anke (University of Gothenburg)","Samulowitz, Anke (University of Gothenburg); Haukenes, Inger (University of Bergen); Grimby-Ekman, Anna (University of Gothenburg); Bergman, Stefan (University of Gothenburg; Spenshult Hospital); Hensing, Gunnel (University of Gothenburg)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283222&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156292045,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being; 5 Gender Equality

Previous experiments with whole-body oxytocin knockout mice showed that milk ejection was the unequivocal function of oxytocin, whereas parturition and maternal behaviors were less dependent on oxytocin. Whole-body knockout, however, could induce the enhancement of expression of related gene(s), a phenomenon called genetic compensation, which may hide the actual functions of oxytocin. In addition, the relative contributions of oxytocin neurons in the PVH and SO have not been well documented. Here, we show that females with conditional knockout of oxytocin gene in both the PVH and SO undergo grossly normal parturition and maternal caregiving behaviors, while dams with a smaller number of remaining oxytocin-expressing neurons exhibit severe impairments in breastfeeding, leading to the death of their pups within 24 hours after birth. We also found that the growth of pups is normal even under oxytocin conditional knockout in PVH and SO as long as pups survive the next day of delivery, suggesting that the reduced oxytocin release affects the onset of lactation most severely. These phenotypes are largely recapitulated by SO-specific oxytocin conditional knockout, indicating the unequivocal role of oxytocin neurons in the SO in successful breastfeeding. Given that oxytocin neurons not only secrete oxytocin but also non-oxytocin neurotransmitters or neuropeptides, we further performed cell ablation of oxytocin neurons in the PVH and SO. We found that cell ablation of oxytocin neurons leads to no additional abnormalities over the oxytocin conditional knockout, suggesting that non-oxytocin ligands expressed by oxytocin neurons have negligible functions on the responses measured in this study. Collectively, our findings confirm the dispensability of oxytocin for parturition or maternal behaviors, as well as the importance of SO-derived oxytocin for breastfeeding.",We wish to thank Satsuki Irie for her technical support.

It is important to explore the possible impacts of the application of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) in order to avoid the possible adverse effects. Prior research has focused on theory to the exclusion of the psychological impact of AIEd, and the empirical research was relatively lacking. This study aimed to identify the influence of AIEd on adolescents' social adaptability via social support. A total of 1332 students were recruited using random sampling from 13 Artificial Intelligence Curriculum Reform Experimental Schools in Guangzhou, Southern China, completed the survey. There were 342 primary school students (Meanage = 10.6), 351 junior high school students (Meanage = 13.1), and 639 senior high school students (Meanage = 15.8). Results showed that AIEd has a negative impact on adolescents' social adaptability, and is significantly negatively correlated with social adaptability and family support, but there is no significant correlation with school support. AIEd could not only affect social adaptability directly, but also could affected it through the family support.","We would like to acknowledge all participants for their time, effort, and contribution.","This study received support from The Major Project of Guangzhou Educational Science Planning (No: 2020zd003).

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse the binding activity of S. aureus to Seraph affinity filters based on heparin coated beads and to identify effectors influencing this binding activity.
RESULTS: To test the binding activity, we used gfp-expressing S. aureus Newman strains inoculated either in 0.9% NaCl or in blood plasma and determined the number of unbound bacteria by FACS analyses after passing through Seraph affinity filters. The binding activity of S. aureus was clearly impaired in human plasma: while a percent removal of 42% was observed in 0.9% NaCl (p-value 0.0472) using Seraph mini columns, a percent removal of only 10% was achieved in human plasma (p-value 0.0934). The different composition of surface proteins in S. aureus caused by the loss of SarA, SigB, Lgt, and SaeS had no significant influence on its binding activity. In a clinically relevant approach using the Seraph® 100 Microbind® Affinity Filter and 1000 ml of human blood plasma from four different donors, the duration of treatment was shown to have a critical effect on the rate of bacterial reduction. Within the first four hours, the number of bacteria decreased continuously and the reduction in bacteria reached statistical significance after two hours of treatment (percentage reduction 64%, p-value 0.01165). The final reduction after four hours of treatment was close to 90% and is dependent on donor. The capacity of Seraph® 100 for S. aureus in human plasma was approximately 5 x 108 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The Seraph affinity filter, based on heparin-coated beads, is a highly efficient method for reducing S. aureus in human blood plasma, with efficiency dependent on blood plasma composition and treatment duration.",We thank ExThera Medical Corporation for supplying Seraph adsorber mini columns and Seraph® 100 Microbind® Affinity blood adsorber.

In 2019, an average of 5.2 out of 42 wrestlers in the top division of professional sumo wrestling were absent in each grand sumo tournament due to injury. As the number of injury occurrences increases, professional sumo wrestling becomes less interesting for sumo fans, requiring systems to prevent future occurrences. Statistical injury prediction is a useful way to communicate the risk of injuries for wrestlers and their coaches. However, the existing statistical methods of injury prediction are not always accurate because they do not consider the long-term effects of injuries. Here, we propose a statistical model of injury occurrences for sumo wrestlers. The proposed model provides the estimated probability of the next potential injury occurrence for a wrestler. In addition, it can support making a risk-based injury prevention scenario for wrestlers. While a previous study modeled injury occurrences by using the Poisson process, we model it by using the Hawkes process to consider the long-term effect of injuries. The proposed model can also be applied to injury prediction for athletes of other sports.",,"This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 19K04892 and 21K14373 (Funder’s website: https://www.jsps.go.jp/english).

Our study aimed to categorise the phenotypes of chronic cough.
METHODS: Adult patients with chronic cough were assessed based on the characteristics and severity of their cough using the COugh Assessment Test (COAT) and the Korean version of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire. A cluster analysis was performed using the K-prototype, and the variables to be included were determined using a correlation network.
RESULTS: In total, 255 participants were included in the analysis. Based on the correlation network, age, score for each item, and total COAT score were selected for the cluster analysis. Four clusters were identified and characterised as follows: 1) elderly with mild cough, 2) middle-aged with less severe cough, 3) relatively male-predominant youth with severe cough, and 4) female-predominant elderly with severe cough. All clusters had distinct demographic and symptomatic characteristics and underlying causes.
CONCLUSIONS: Cluster analysis of age, score for each item, and total COAT score identified 4 distinct phenotypes of chronic cough with significant differences in the aetiologies.

Systematic detection of IPV is not well established in antenatal screening probably because the effectiveness of protective interventions has not been evaluated. E-health interventions may be beneficial among mothers exposed to IPV. Prior to performing a full-scale effectiveness trial for such an intervention, a pilot study is required to assess the feasibility of randomising a sufficiently large number of women exposed to IPV during pregnancy. The eIPV trial is a randomised pilot study nested within a cohort of consenting mothers who screen positive for IPV in the first antenatal visit at <12 weeks' gestation and accept an e-health package (psychological counselling by videoconference) in Spain and Denmark. Twenty eligible mothers from the above cohort will be randomised to either intervention or control. The intervention group will receive the e-health package as part of the cohort. The control group will be invited to accept a delay in the intervention (e-health package eight weeks later). After consenting to delay, the control group will provide comparative data without losing the opportunity of obtaining the intervention. We will determine estimates of rates of informed consent to randomization, and the rates of adherence and dropout following randomization. Qualitative interviews will be conducted to examine the women's perception about the benefit of the intervention, reasons for acceptability and non-adherence, and obstacles to recruitment, randomisation and consent.

An induction protocol with low doses of oxytocin has been reported as a safe procedure. This study investigates the effect of induced delivery on at-term mares' sympathetic-vagal balance. Fourteen mares were included and divided into two groups, one subjected to spontaneous delivery (SD), and one to induced delivery (ID). In both groups, an ECG was recorded using an elastic belt with integrated smart textile electrodes. The recording started before the delivery (Basal), continued close to delivery (Pre-delivery) and during delivery (Delivery), and ended after parturition (Placental expulsion). From the ECGs, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters relating to time and frequency domains and non-linear analysis were extrapolated. The HRV analysis was performed both within the same group (IntraGA) and between the two groups (InterGA). In the present study, spontaneous and induced delivery did not appear to differ in autonomic nervous system functioning. In IntraGA analysis, both for SD and ID mares, delivery and placental expulsion periods were parasympathetic dominated since vagal-related HRV parameters increased. Moreover, no differences were found in InterGA comparison between SD and ID mares, except for the pre-delivery period of ID mares, during which both branches of the autonomic nervous system were activated. These results are in line with the literature on parasympathetic dominance during parturition and no change in Heart Rate Variability following exogenous oxytocin administration in parturient mares.","We are grateful to the stud farm “La Piaggia” (Tuscany, Italy) for the technical support.",The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Pregnancy; Animals; Horses; Female; Humans; Oxytocin; Placenta; Parturition; Autonomic Nervous System; Dystocia,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,18,3,e0283116,All OA; Gold,Article,"Felici, Martina; Sgorbini, Micaela; Baragli, Paolo; Lanatà, Antonio; Marmorini, Paola; Camillo, Francesco","Felici, Martina (Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy; Department of Agricultural and Food Science (DISTAL), University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy); Sgorbini, Micaela (Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy; Veterinary Teaching Hospital “Mario Modenato”, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy); Baragli, Paolo (Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy); Lanatà, Antonio (Department of Information Engineering, University of Florence, Firenze, Italy); Marmorini, Paola (Private Practitioner, Pisa, Italy); Camillo, Francesco (Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy; Veterinary Teaching Hospital “Mario Modenato”, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy)","Felici, Martina (University of Pisa; University of Bologna)","Felici, Martina (University of Pisa; University of Bologna); Sgorbini, Micaela (University of Pisa; University of Pisa); Baragli, Paolo (University of Pisa); Lanatà, Antonio (University of Florence); Marmorini, Paola (); Camillo, Francesco (University of Pisa; University of Pisa)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283116&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156292002,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3009 Veterinary Sciences",

Previous research using placental cell lines and ex vivo trophoblast preparations have highlighted hyperglycemia is an important independent regulator of placental function. However, it is poorly understood if hyperglycemia directly influences aspects of placental metabolic function, including nutrient storage and mitochondrial respiration, that are altered in term diabetic placentae. The current study examined metabolic and mitochondrial function as well as nutrient storage in both undifferentiated cytotrophoblast and differentiated syncytiotrophoblast BeWo cells cultured under hyperglycemia conditions (25 mM glucose) for 72 hours to further characterize the direct impacts of placental hyperglycemic exposure. Hyperglycemic-exposed BeWo trophoblasts displayed increased glycogen and triglyceride nutrient stores, but real-time functional readouts of metabolic enzyme activity and mitochondrial respiratory activity were not altered. However, specific investigation into mitochondrial dynamics highlighted increased expression of markers associated with mitochondrial fission that could indicate high glucose-exposed trophoblasts are transitioning towards mitochondrial dysfunction. To further characterize the impacts of independent hyperglycemia, the current study subsequently utilized a multi-omics approach and evaluated the transcriptomic and metabolomic signatures of BeWo cytotrophoblasts. BeWo cytotrophoblasts exposed to hyperglycemia displayed increased mRNA expression of ACSL1, HSD11B2, RPS6KA5, and LAP3 and reduced mRNA expression of CYP2F1, and HK2, concomitant with increased levels of: lactate, malonate, and riboflavin metabolites. These changes highlighted important underlying alterations to glucose, glutathione, fatty acid, and glucocorticoid metabolism in BeWo trophoblasts exposed to hyperglycemia. Overall, these results demonstrate that hyperglycemia is an important independent regulator of key areas of placental metabolism, nutrient storage, and mitochondrial function, and these data continue to expand our knowledge on mechanisms governing the development of placental dysfunction.","The authors would like to thank Dr. Ousseynou Sarr for his guidance and assistance in analyzing the microarray data presented in this manuscript, as well as Dr. Barbra de Vrijer for her assistance in reviewing the manuscript drafts.","This project was supported by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Human Placenta Project Grant (grant No. U01 HD087181-01) to TRHR - Co PI. https://www.nichd.nih.gov/grants-contracts.

The role of local officials’ tenure,"The existing literature on corporate social responsibility (CSR) drivers focuses on firm- and institution-level factors and rarely on the role of political incentives. Public officials control enormous resources in China, and their political incentives substantially shape certain firm behaviors. As CSR is one of the critical measures that the central government uses to evaluate the performance of local government, local officials have the incentive to channel firms into accomplishing their political goals. Correspondingly, local firms may strategically implement CSR to build a good relationship with local governments. This study investigates the impact of local officials' political incentives (measured by tenure) on firms' CSR. Using a panel of publicly listed Chinese firms covering 2009-2019, it documents a U-shaped effect of government officials' tenure on the CSR performance of firms within their jurisdiction. To wit, the firm's CSR decreases first and then increases with the growth of tenure.

This study aimed to describe the burden of derangements in serum electrolytes and kidney function in children presenting to a tertiary hospital in Nigeria.
METHODS: The laboratory records of all children who had serum electrolytes urea and creatinine ordered on their first presentation to hospital between January 1 and June 30, 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Basic demographic data including admission status (inpatient or outpatient) were recordedandserum levels of sodium, potassium, chloride and bicarbonate were assessed for derangements usingnormal values from established reference ranges. Results of repeat samples were excluded. Kidney function was classified based on the serum creatinine relative to normal values for age and sex.
RESULTS: During the study period, 1909 children (60.3% male); median (IQR) age 42 (11.9) months had serum chemistry and 1248 (65.4%) were admitted. Results of their first samples were analyzed. Electrolyte derangements were present in 78.6% of the samples most commonly hyponatraemia (41.1%), low bicarbonate(37.2%), hypochloraemia (33.5%) and hypokalemia(18.9%). Azotaemia was found in 20.1% of the results. Elevated serum creatinine levels were found in 399 children (24.7%), 24.1% of those being in the severe category. Children aged 5 years and younger accounted for 76.4% of those with derangement in kidney function. One hundred and eight outpatients (17.8%) had deranged kidney function.
CONCLUSION: Deranged serum electrolytes and kidney function were common in this cohort.","I thank the staff of Department of Chemical Pathology, AKTH for assistance with retrieval of data.",The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Humans; Male; Child; Female; Tertiary Care Centers; Retrospective Studies; Bicarbonates; Nigeria; Creatinine; Electrolytes; Kidney,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,18,3,e0283220,All OA; Gold,Article,"Obiagwu, Patience N.; Morrow, Brenda; McCulloch, Mignon; Argent, Andrew","Obiagwu, Patience N.

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate this phenomenon by examining in-depth individuals who consider the label HS essential to their self-definition. In semi-structured interviews, 38 individuals described their understanding of HS and its perceived manifestations and impact on their lives (among other topics). Subsequently, the data were content-analytically evaluated, i.e., categorized and quantified. One key finding was that HS individuals feel relief following self-attribution or self-diagnosis. Moreover, this self-attribution replaced the feeling of being somehow different from the others, which almost all interviewees mentioned, with positive attributes. The main negative features of HS mentioned were feeling overwhelmed by sensory and emotional stimuli.

It also examines the mediating role that perception of climate change has on the aforementioned association. A 46-item survey (n = 588) was conducted in the Geelong region of Australia. Logistic regression was used to determine the independent association between perceived water scarcity and socio-demographic factors, with support for alternative water sources, desalination and recycled water. 82% of respondents supported undefined 'alternative water sources'. However, support for specific alternatives was lower (desalination: 65%; recycled water: 40.3%). Perception of water scarcity was significantly associated with increased odds of support for alternative water sources (OR 1.94, 95% CI: 1.25-3.00) and support for recycled water (OR 2.32, 95% CI: 1.68-3.31). There was no significant relationship between perception of water scarcity and support for desalination (OR 0.959 95% CI: 0.677-1.358). Climate change was found to mediate perceived water scarcity and support for alternative sources (OR 1.360, 95% CI: 0.841-2.198). The mediation of the relationship between perceived water scarcity and support for recycled water by climate change was not strong.

This might affect driver behavior, which, in turn, impacts the driving outcomes. This study aims to investigate the relationship between socio-demographic variables, driving anger, and the self-reported aberrant behavior among Lebanese drivers and to determine which anger dimension is linked to driving behavior. A cross-sectional study was conducted among eligible Lebanese drivers from all Lebanese governorates. Data were collected using an anonymous Arabic self-reported questionnaire that included demographic information, driving-related variables, and two scales: the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) and the Driver Anger Scale (DAS). Four hierarchical regressions were performed taking the DBQ subscales as the dependent variable and the DAS subscales as independent variables. Out of 1102 surveyed drivers, 68.4% were males, having a mean age of 34.6 ± 12.3 years and an average driving experience of 13.5 ± 10.8 years. DBQ, DAS, and their subscales showed good reliability. Older age and female gender were negatively associated with the tendency of committing aggressive violations. However, being a professional driver and increasing annual mileage were positively associated with a higher tendency to commit aggressive violations. In addition to these factors, a higher educational level was found associated with a lower risk of driver's involvement in traffic violations. However, increased driving experience was associated with a higher tendency to commit aggressive violations. Reported driving errors were also found positively associated with older age, increasing mileage, and being a professional driver. However, larger driving experience and higher education were found protectors from erroneous behavior. Hierarchical regression showed that anger prompted by hostile gesture, discourtesy, police presence, traffic obstruction, and slow driving were positively associated with aggressive violations. All the DAS subscales were found to be positively associated with ordinary violations. traffic obstruction was also found associated with a higher tendency of drivers to commit lapses, as well as anger, which originated from police presence and slow driving which were found also positively associated with errors. Driver anger dimensions were found positively associated with aberrant driver behavior. To overcome road anger, there is a need to train drivers on coping strategies to restrain aberrant driving behavior.","The authors acknowledge all drivers who participated in this study as well as the students of traffic major in IPNET Lebanese Higher Institute of Technical &amp; Professional, Bir Hassan who helped us in the data collection.",The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,"Male; Humans; Female; Young Adult; Adult; Middle Aged; Self Report; Cross-Sectional Studies; Lebanon; Reproducibility of Results; Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; Surveys and Questionnaires; Anger; Risk-Taking",2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,18,3,e0283293,All OA; Gold,Article,"Youssef, Dalal; Salameh, Pascale; Abou-Abbas, Linda; Salmi, Louis-Rachid","Youssef, Dalal (ISPED School of Public Health, Bordeaux University, UMR_S 1219—Research Center Bordeaux Population Health (BPH), Bordeaux, France; Clinical Trial Program, Ministry of Public Health, Beirut, Lebanon; Lebanese Higher Institute of Technical & Professional (IPNET), Beirut, Lebanon; Institut National de Santé Publique, Epidémiologie Clinique et Toxicologie (INSPECT-LB), Beirut, Lebanon); Salameh, Pascale (Institut National de Santé Publique, Epidémiologie Clinique et Toxicologie (INSPECT-LB), Beirut, Lebanon; School of Medicine, Lebanese American University, Byblos, Lebanon; Department of Research, Faculty of Pharmacy, Lebanese University, Hadat, Lebanon; Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University of Nicosia Medical School, Nicosia, Cyprus); Abou-Abbas, Linda (Neuroscience Research Center, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon); Salmi, Louis-Rachid (ISPED School of Public Health, Bordeaux University, UMR_S 1219—Research Center Bordeaux Population Health (BPH), Bordeaux, France)","Youssef, Dalal (University of Bordeaux; Ministry of Public Health; ; )","Youssef, Dalal (University of Bordeaux; Ministry of Public Health); Salameh, Pascale (Lebanese American University; Lebanese University; University of Nicosia); Abou-Abbas, Linda (Lebanese University); Salmi, Louis-Rachid (University of Bordeaux)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283293&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156292083,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

Personal- and work-related factors generally influence work engagement. However, data on work engagement in pediatric clinical practice are limited.
METHODS: This study employed a cross-sectional design, including 230 registered nurses working in pediatric units in Madinah, Saudi Arabia. A non-probability approach (convenience sampling) was adopted in recruiting the sample. Eight personal- and work-related variables were examined using the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale shortened 9-item version.
RESULTS: The overall mean scale score was 4.54 (standard deviation = 0.95). The dedication subscale showed the highest mean score (4.84), followed by the absorption (4.48) and vigor subscales (4.29). A higher work engagement score was associated with an older age (H = 17.892; p < 0.001), a non-Saudi nationality (Z = 5.724; p < 0.001), a higher educational level (Z = 3.178; p = 0.001), and a long duration of experience (>10 years) (H = 18.435; p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between the total scale score according to marital status (p = 0.077), current working unit (p = 0.063), and current working hours (p = 0.067).

In order to ensure stope stability in the mining process, it is necessary to evaluate stope stability for a more stable stope structure. However, there are many kinds of methods for rock stability assessment, and most of them are based on empirical and analytical methods, which lead to uncertain results. In this paper, a comprehensive evaluation method including factors of stope stability, self-stabilization time, maximum safety span, and support measure is determined, which is more likely to provide a comprehensive result. Finally, it was verified by the field application in Jiaojia Gold Mine. Results show that it can accurately evaluate the stope stability from different aspects compared with the traditional single evaluation method, and it leads to a more comprehensive and reliable result.",,"This work was funded by National Key R&D Programme of China (2021YFC3001304) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(N2101044).

We investigated BALF biomarkers for PF-ILD diagnosis and prognosis assessment. Overall, 120 patients with interstitial pneumonia who could be diagnosed with PF-ILD or non PF-ILD were enrolled in this retrospective study. PF-ILD was diagnosed according to Cottin's definition. All patients underwent bronchoscopy and BALF collection. We evaluated blood and BALF parameters, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) patterns, and spirometry data to identify factors influencing PF-ILD diagnosis and prognosis. On univariate logistic analysis, age, sex, the BALF white blood cell fraction (neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), BALF flow cytometric analysis (CD8), and an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on HRCT were correlated with PF-ILD diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that sex (male), age (cut-off 62 years, area under the curve [AUC] 0.67; sensitivity 0.80; specificity 0.47), white blood cell fraction in BALF (NLR, neutrophil, and lymphocyte), and CD8 in BALF (cut-off 34.2; AUC 0.66; sensitivity, 0.74; specificity, 0.62) were independent diagnostic predictors for PF-ILD. In BALF, the NLR (cut-off 8.70, AUC 0.62; sensitivity 0.62; specificity 0.70), neutrophil count (cut-off 3.0, AUC 0.59; sensitivity 0.57; specificity 0.63), and lymphocyte count (cut-off 42.0, AUC 0.63; sensitivity 0.77; specificity 0.53) were independent diagnostic predictors. In PF-ILD patients (n = 77), lactate dehydrogenase (cut-off 275, AUC 0.69; sensitivity 0.57; specificity 0.78), Krebs von den Lungen-6 (cut-off 1,140, AUC 0.74; sensitivity 0.71; specificity 0.76), baseline forced vital capacity (FVC) (cut-off 1.75 L, AUC 0.71; sensitivity, 0.93; specificity, 0.46), and BALF neutrophil ratio (cut-off 6.0, AUC 0.72; sensitivity 0.79; specificity 0.80) correlated with death within 3 years.

METHODS: Using data from a cross-sectional study that enrolled index participants with rifampin-resistant pulmonary TB and their household contacts (HHCs), we evaluated HHCs age ≥15 years for factors associated with two outcomes: Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and TB disease. Among HHCs who were not already diagnosed with current active TB disease by the TB program, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was determined by interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). TB disease was adjudicated centrally. We fitted logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations.
RESULTS: Seven hundred twelve HHCs age ≥15 years enrolled from 279 households in eight high-TB burden countries were a median age of 34 years, 63% female, 22% current smokers and 8% previous smokers, 8% HIV-positive, and 11% previously treated for TB. Of 686 with determinate IGRA results, 471 tested IGRA positive (prevalence 68.8% (95% Confidence Interval: 64.6%, 72.8%)). Multivariable modeling showed IGRA positivity was more common in HHCs aged 25-49 years; reporting prior TB treatment; reporting incarceration, substance use, and/or a period of daily alcohol use in the past 12 months; sharing a sleeping room or more evenings spent with the index participant; living with smokers; or living in a home of materials typical of low socioeconomic status. Forty-six (6.5% (95% Confidence Interval: 4.6%, 9.0%)) HHCs age ≥15 years had prevalent TB disease. Multivariable modeling showed higher prevalence of TB disease among HHCs aged ≥50 years; reporting current or previous smoking; reporting a period of daily alcohol use in the past 12 months; and reporting prior TB treatment.
CONCLUSION: We identified overlapping and distinct characteristics associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and TB disease that may be useful for those conducting household TB investigations.","The authors thank the study participants, site community advisory boards, and members of the study team.

When a linear regression model is used to fit data, selecting appropriate explanatory variables that strongly impact the response variables has a significant effect on the model prediction accuracy and interpretation effect. redThis study introduces the Bayesian adaptive group Lasso method to solve the variable selection problem under a mixed linear regression model with a hidden state and explanatory variables with a grouping structure. First, the definition of the implicit state mixed linear regression model is presented. Thereafter, the Bayesian adaptive group Lasso method is used to determine the penalty function and parameters, after which each parameter's specific form of the fully conditional posterior distribution is calculated. Moreover, the Gibbs algorithm design is outlined. Simulation experiments are conducted to compare the variable selection and parameter estimation effects in different states. Finally, a dataset of Alzheimer's Disease is used for application analysis. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can identify the observation from different hidden states, but the results of the variable selection in different states are obviously different.",,"This article is partially supported by the fund of Yunnan Provincial Science and Technology Department of China (Award Number: 2019FH001-108).

Digital transformation is a significant driving force behind enterprise-specific production and innovation. Furthermore, enterprise innovation and enterprise-specialized production play a mediating role in the impact of enterprise digital transformation on capacity utilization. Based on these baseline findings, heterogenous analysis reveals that the impact of digital transformation on capacity utilization is significant for firms with larger capital scales or poor governance and manufacturing abilities. However, it is less important for enterprises with small- and medium-sized capital scales or with more standardized governance, as well as non-manufacturing (service) enterprises.","We wish to thank Shi Junwei, Liu Xinglin, Hu Shan, and Guo Yanbing.

Irrespective of their resistance to bending, a key driver of such phenomena is Gauss' Theorema Egregium, which implies that naturally flat sheets cannot conform to doubly curved surfaces without developing a strain whose magnitude grows sharply with the curved area. Previous attempts to characterize the onset of curvature-induced delamination, and the complex patterns it gives rise to, assumed a dewetting-like mechanism in which the propensity of two materials to form contact through interfacial energy is modified by an elastic energy penalty. We show that this approach may characterize moderately bendable sheets but fails qualitatively to describe the curvature-induced delamination of ultrathin films, whose mechanics is governed by their propensity to buckle and delaminate partially, under minute levels of compression. Combining mechanical and geometrical considerations, we introduce a minimal model for curvature-induced delamination accounting for the two buckling motifs that underlie partial delamination: shallow ""rucks"" and localized ""folds"". We predict nontrivial scaling rules for the onset of curvature-induced delamination and various features of the emerging patterns, which compare well with experiments. Beyond gaining control on the use of ultrathin adhesives in cutting-edge technologies such as stretchable electronics, our analysis is a significant step toward quantifying the multiscale morphology that emerges upon imposing geometrical and mechanical constraints on highly bendable solid objects.","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Programme/ERC Grant Agreement no. 637334 (DV), the Royal Society through URF/R1/211730 (FB), the Leverhulme Trust (DV), the NSF under grant DMR 1822439 (BD), and a visiting professor fellowship from ENS Lyon (June 2018), where this work was commenced.

Because occupational aspirations start to develop during early childhood, it seems crucial to foster our understanding of which factors affect occupational aspirations during this period. Earlier correlational research showed that the status of occupations seems to be one important factor. Therefore, in the current work, we experimentally tested the effect of two dimensions of status (i.e., salary and power) on children's occupational aspirations and examined its interaction with child gender. We also tested the relationship among gender, self-perceptions, and occupational values. Using a 2 (Salary: high vs. low) × 2 (Power: high vs. low) within-participants design (N = 127 [59 boys and 68 girls], Mage = 9.37 years, SD = 0.50) with child gender as a between-participants factor, we show positive main effects of both salary and power on children's occupational aspirations but no interaction with gender. Correlational analyses show preliminary evidence for the mediating role of agentic self-perceptions in the relationship between gender and occupational values related to status. Thus, we provide evidence for the causal effect of occupational status on children's occupational aspirations but show experimentally that this is independent of child gender. Interestingly, the correlational analyses indicate that gender norms might play a role given that boys in trend reported stronger agentic self-perceptions, which then were associated with a stronger desire to pursue high-status occupations. Implications for early interventions to reduce occupational gender segregation are discussed.",,,Journal of Experimental Child Psychology,,,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,2023-08,232,,105667,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Olsen, Marte; Parks-Stamm, Elizabeth J; Thorsteinsen, Kjærsti; Martiny, Sarah E","Olsen, Marte (Department of Psychology, Research Group Social Psychology, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, 9019 Tromsø, Norway.

Specifically, it examined whether individuals who follow mindfulness experts on Twitter use different language in their tweets compared to a random sample of Twitter users. This is a first step which may complement commonly used self-report measures of mindfulness with quantifiable behavioural metrics.MethodA linguistic analysis examined the association between an interest in mindfulness and linguistic markers in 1.87 million Twitter entries across 19,732 users from two groups, (1) a mindfulness interest group (n = 10,347) comprising followers of five mindfulness experts and (2) a control group (n = 9385) of a random selection of Twitter users. Text analysis software (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) was used to analyse linguistic markers associated with the categories and subcategories of mindfulness, affective processes, social orientation, and “being” mode of mind.ResultsAnalyses revealed an association between an interest in mindfulness and lexical choice. Specifically, tweets from the mindfulness interest group contained a significantly higher frequency of markers associated with mindfulness, positive emotion, happiness, and social orientation, and a significantly lower frequency of markers associated with negative emotion, past focus, present focus, future focus, family orientation, and friend orientation.ConclusionsResults from this study suggest that an interest in mindfulness is associated with more frequent use of certain language markers on Twitter. The analysis opens possible pathways towards developing more naturalistic methods of understanding and assessing mindfulness which may complement self-reporting methods.",,,Mindfulness,,,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,,,1-12,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Rivera, Clara Eugenia; Kaunhoven, Rebekah Jane; Griffith, Gemma Maria","Rivera, Clara Eugenia (Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, School of Human and Behavioural Sciences, Bangor University, Brigantia Building, Penrallt Road, LL57 2AS, Bangor, UK); Kaunhoven, Rebekah Jane (Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, School of Human and Behavioural Sciences, Bangor University, Brigantia Building, Penrallt Road, LL57 2AS, Bangor, UK); Griffith, Gemma Maria (Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice, School of Human and Behavioural Sciences, Bangor University, Brigantia Building, Penrallt Road, LL57 2AS, Bangor, UK)","Griffith, Gemma Maria (Bangor University)","Rivera, Clara Eugenia (Bangor University); Kaunhoven, Rebekah Jane (Bangor University); Griffith, Gemma Maria (Bangor University)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12671-023-02098-4.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156292965,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,

As the authors attend to more-than-human life, they theorize and enact relational ways of knowing. Through participatory and multisensory pedagogies, they counter dichotomies between nonhuman and human nature, student and teacher. In this response, I consider how this (re)centering of more-than-human relations expands—and counters—Freire’s thinking, including how he articulates humanization as a primary, liberatory aim of teaching and (un)learning. Along with insights from Black geographies and Black feminist ecologies, bell hooks guides my response. hooks critiqued and engaged with Freire’s work with radical care, with space for complexity and accountability.

One approach of service provision is the Routines-Based Model which implements adult-learning practices wherein service providers and caregivers partner to build family-mediated interventions for children. Owing to COVID-19 and the benefits of telepractice, more and more service providers are likely to incorporate a telepractice modality into service provision. Because the Routines-Based Model uses family consultation, these home-visiting practices translate well to telepractice. In addition to consultation techniques, however, service providers must use technology advantageously to ensure effective communication practices.

Comments in online social media have been analyzed to find and stop the spread of negativity using methods such as hate speech detection, identification of offensive language or detection of abusive language. We define hope speech as the type of speech that is able to relax a hostile environment and that helps, gives suggestions and inspires for good to a number of people when they are in times of illness, stress, loneliness or depression. Detecting it automatically, in order to give greater diffusion to positive comments, can have a very significant effect when it comes to fighting against sexual or racial discrimination or when we intend to foster less bellicose environments. In this article we perform a complete study on hope speech, analyzing existing solutions and available resources. In addition, we have generated a quality resource, SpanishHopeEDI, a new Spanish Twitter dataset on LGBT community, and we have conducted some experiments that can serve as a baseline for further research.","This work has been partially supported by Project CONSENSO (PID2021-122263OB-C21), Project MODERATES (TED2021-130145B-I00) and Project SocialTox (PDC2022-133146-C21) funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by the European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR, Project LaTe4PSP (PID2019-107652RB-I00/AEI/ 10.13039/501100011033) funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, Project AlInFunds (PDC2021-121112-I00) and Project LT-SWM (TED2021-131167B-I00) funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by the European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR, Project PID2020-116118GA-I00 supported by MICINN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, Project PID2020-119478GB-I00 supported by MICINN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, and Big Hug project (P20_00956, PAIDI 2020) and WeLee project (1380939, FEDER Andalucía 2014-2020) funded by the Andalusian Regional Government.

Through a series of focus groups with organizations involved in produce recovery (gleaning organizations) and emergency food operations (food banks, food pantries), this study aimed to deepen our understanding of the current produce recovery system and determine the major challenges and opportunities related to the produce recovery system. Operational and systematic barriers to produce recovery were highlighted by both gleaning and emergency food operations. Operational barriers, such as the lack of appropriate infrastructure and limited logistical support were found to be a challenge across groups and were directly tied to inadequate funding for these organizations. Systematic barriers, such as regulations related to food safety or reducing food loss and waste, were also found to impact both gleaning and emergency food organizations, but differences were observed in how each type of regulation impacted each stakeholder group. To support the expansion of food recovery efforts, participants expressed need for better coordination within and across food recovery networks and more positive and transparent engagement from regulators to increase understanding of the specifics of their unique operational constraints. The focus group participants also provided critiques on how emergency food assistance and food recovery are inscribed within the current food system and for longer term goals of reducing food insecurity and food loss and waste a systematic change will be required.",,"This study was funded by the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA) Specialty Crop Research Initiative, Award Number 2018-51181-28441 and USDA-NIFA Multistate Project S1077.",Agriculture and Human Values,,,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,,,1-20,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Chiarella, Cristina; Lamoureaux, Yulia; Pires, Alda A.

The evaluation and suitability of these selected features are often analyzed using classifiers. These features are locked with data increasingly being generated from different sources such as social media, surveillance systems, network applications, and medical records. The high dimensionality of these datasets often impairs the quality of the optimal combination of these features selected. The use of the binary optimization method has been proposed in the literature to address this challenge. However, the underlying deficiency of the single binary optimizer is transferred to the quality of the features selected. Though hybrid methods have been proposed, most still suffer from the inherited design limitation of the single combined methods. To address this, we proposed a novel hybrid binary optimization capable of effectively selecting features from increasingly high-dimensional datasets. The approach used in this study designed a sub-population selective mechanism that dynamically assigns individuals to a 2-level optimization process. The level-1 method first mutates items in the population and then reassigns them to a level-2 optimizer. The selective mechanism determines what sub-population is assigned for the level-2 optimizer based on the exploration and exploitation phase of the level-1 optimizer. In addition, we designed nested transfer (NT) functions and investigated the influence of the function on the level-1 optimizer. The binary Ebola optimization search algorithm (BEOSA) is applied for the level-1 mutation, while the simulated annealing (SA) and firefly (FFA) algorithms are investigated for the level-2 optimizer. The outcome of these are the HBEOSA-SA and HBEOSA-FFA, which are then investigated on the NT, and their corresponding variants HBEOSA-SA-NT and HBEOSA-FFA-NT with no NT applied. The hybrid methods were experimentally tested over high-dimensional datasets to address the challenge of feature selection. A comparative analysis was done on the methods to obtain performance variability with the low-dimensional datasets. Results obtained for classification accuracy for large, medium, and small-scale datasets are 0.995 using HBEOSA-FFA, 0.967 using HBEOSA-FFA-NT, and 0.953 using HBEOSA-FFA, respectively. Fitness and cost values relative to large, medium, and small-scale datasets are 0.066 and 0.934 using HBEOSA-FFA, 0.068 and 0.932 using HBEOSA-FFA, with 0.222 and 0.970 using HBEOSA-SA-NT, respectively.

While traditional contexts can prime stereotypical gender roles and promote conditions that lead to performance differences, these can be mitigated by context shifts. This proof-of-concept study explores whether an easy-to-apply context shift, moving from seated indoors to walking outside, can help improve the quality of negotiated interactions. Here we examine walking's effects on negotiation and relational outcomes as well as experienced emotions, moderated by gender.
DESIGN: Same-gender pairs were randomly assigned to either sitting or walking as either candidate or recruiter negotiating a job offer.
PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-one pairs of graduate students or community members participated: sitting pairs: 27 women, 14 men; walking pairs: 23 women, 17 men.
INTERVENTION: Participants negotiated either while seated (across from each other) or walking (side by side along a path).
MEASURES: We measured: negotiation performance (total points) and outcome equity (difference between negotiating party points); subjective outcomes of positive emotions, negative emotions, mutual liking, and mutual trust. With mixed effects models, we tested main effects of condition, gender, and interaction of condition x gender.
RESULTS: Relative to sitting, walking was associated with: increased outcome equality for women, but decreased for men (B = 3799.1, SE = 1679.9, p = .027); decreased negative emotions, more for women than men (IRR = .83, 95% CI:[.69,1.00], p = .046); and greater mutual liking for both genders (W = 591.5, p-value = 0.027). No significant effects were found for negotiation point totals, positive emotions, or mutual trust.

First, we mined 15 consecutive years of CEOs' CVs from 2006 to 2020 from Chinese listed companies. Second, we extracted information throughout their careers and automatically classified their functional hierarchy. Finally, we constructed breadth (functional breadth: functional experience richness) and depth (functional depth: average tenure and the hierarchy of function) for empirical analysis. We found that a CEO's breadth is significantly negatively related to firm performance, and the quadratic term is significantly positive. A CEO's depth is significantly positively related to firm performance, and the quadratic term is significantly negative. The research results indicate a u-shaped relationship between a CEO's breadth and firm performance and an inverted u-shaped relationship between their depth and firm performance. The study's findings extend the literature on factors influencing firm performance and CEOs' functional experience.

The German part focuses on the subjective perceptions of general practitioners on primary health care and the impact of political measures during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within this survey, the ""open text field"" of the questionnaire was utilised remarkably frequently and extensively by the respondents. It became clear that the content that was named needed to be analysed in an exploratory manner. Accordingly, this paper addresses the following question: What preoccupies general practitioners in Germany during COVID-19 that we have not yet asked them enough?
METHODS: The data collection took place throughout Germany from 01.02.2021 to 28.02.2021with a quantitative online questionnaire consisting of 53 items arranged across six topics as well as an ""open text field"" for further comments. The questionnaire's open text field was analysed following the premises of the qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: The topics discussed by the respondents were: insufficient support from health policies, not being prioritised and involved in the vaccination strategy, feeling insufficient prepared, that infrastructural changes and financial concerns threatened the practice, and perceiving the own role as important, as well as that health policies affected the wellbeing of the respondents. One of the main points was the way general practitioners were not sufficiently acknowledged for their contribution to ensuring high-quality care during the pandemic.
DISCUSSION: German general practitioners perceived their work and role as highly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic. In controversy with their perception, they described political conditions in which they were the ones who contributed significantly to the fight against the pandemic but were not given enough recognition.","This is a secondary analysis of the PRICOV-19 study on the national level of Germany.

Ex-vivo study,"OBJECTIVE: Uterine size is one of the essential factors determining the feasibility of a minimally invasive gynecologic surgery approach. A traditional electromechanical morcellator is a well-known tool but not without flaws. We aim to assess feasibility and safety of a novel intrauterine power morcellation device for uterine size reduction to overcome these limitations during hysterectomy.
METHODS: This single-arm, observational study was conducted in a single tertiary care medical center from April 2022 to July 2022. Feasibility and safety of a novel intrauterine morcellation device for uterine size reduction was tested in ten post-hysterectomy uteri (Ex-vivo).
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ten uteri were examined in this trial. No major complications occurred during the procedure. All ten (10) uteri were successfully reduced in size (size reduction range was between 9% to 54%). The average resection time using the Heracure Device was 4.3 minutes (range: 1min- 10min). Mean uterus weight reduction was 21%, with a mean circumference reduction of 25%. No leakage was observed from the outer surface of the uterus/serosa after the saline injection post-procedure examination.
CONCLUSION: In this novel experiment, we verified the feasibility and safety of the Heracure device for vaginal intra-uterine morcellation for uterine size reduction. This technique could enable rapid and easy removal of the uterus through the vaginal orifice.

Vitrification at the GV stage but not at the pronuclear stage significantly increased the abundance of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA measured by the relative fluorescence after γH2AX immunostaining. Treatment of GV-stage oocytes with cryoprotectant agents alone had no effect on DSB levels. When oocytes were vitrified at the GV stage and subjected to in vitro maturation and fertilization (Day 0) and embryo culture, significantly increased DSB levels were detected in subsequent cleavage-stage embryos which were associated with low cell numbers on Day 2, the upregulation of the RAD51 gene at the 4-8 cell stage (measured by RT-qPCR) and reduced developmental ability to the blastocyst stage when compared with the non-vitrified control. However, total cell numbers and percentages of apoptotic cells (measured by TUNEL) in resultant blastocysts were not different from those of the non-vitrified control. On the other hand, vitrification of zygotes had no effect on DSB levels and the expression of DNA-repair genes in resultant embryos, and their development did not differ from that of the non-vitrified control. These results indicate that during vitrification GV-stage oocytes are more susceptible to DNA damages than zygotes, which affects their subsequent development to the blastocyst stage.","We thank Ms. Mitsuru Nagai, for technical assistance.","This work (T.S.) was supported by The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI, grant number: 21K05912).

Recent nonhuman primate (NHP) trauma models have been used to characterize the systemic response to trauma, but none have incorporated a critical care phase without the use of general anesthesia. We describe the development of a prolonged critical care environment with sedation and ventilation support, and also report corresponding NHP biologic and inflammatory markers.
METHODS: Eight adult male rhesus macaques underwent ventilation with sedation for 48-96 hours in a critical care setting. Three of these NHPs underwent ""sham"" procedures as part of trauma control model development. Blood counts, chemistries, coagulation studies, and cytokines/chemokines were collected throughout the study, and histopathologic analysis was conducted at necropsy.
RESULTS: Eight NHPs were intentionally survived and extubated. Three NHPs were euthanized at 72-96 hours without extubation. Transaminitis occurred over the duration of ventilation, but renal function, acid-base status, and hematologic profile remained stable. Chemokine and cytokine analysis were notable for baseline fold-change for Il-6 and Il-1ra (9.7 and 42.7, respectively) that subsequently downtrended throughout the experiment unless clinical respiratory compromise was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: A NHP critical care environment with ventilation support is feasible but requires robust resources. The inflammatory profile of NHPs is not profoundly altered by sedation and mechanical ventilation. NHPs are susceptible to the pulmonary effects of short-term ventilation and demonstrate a similar bioprofile response to ventilator-induced pulmonary pathology. This work has implications for further development of a prolonged care NHP model.","Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Navy, Department of Defense, nor the U.S. Government.

The tillering stage is the key growth period that controls rice yield. Prohexadione-calcium (Pro-Ca) can increase the lodging resistance of plants by reducing plant height, but its effects on rice leaves and roots at the tillering stage under salt stress are still unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of foliar spraying of Pro-Ca to regulate growth quality at the rice tillering stage under salt stress. The results showed that salt stress reduced the tillering ability of the rice and the antioxidant enzyme activity in the roots. Salt stress also reduced the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs) and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) of the rice leaves and increased the contents of osmotic regulatory substances in the leaves and roots. The application of exogenous Pro-Ca onto the leaves increased the tiller number of the rice under salt stress and significantly increased the photosynthetic capacity of the leaves. Additionally, it increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the AsA content. The contents of an osmotic regulation substance, malondialdehyde (MDA), and H2O2 in the leaves and roots also decreased. These results suggested that Pro-Ca can increase the tillering ability, photosynthetic capacity, osmotic adjustment substance content levels and antioxidant enzyme activity levels in rice and reduce membrane lipid peroxidation, thus improving the salt tolerance of rice at the tillering stage.",We are very grateful to all authors for their contributions to this article.

In blood serum for example, HDC changes result from either concentration changes or altered thermal stabilities for 7-10 proteins and has previously been shown capable of differentiating between sick and healthy human subjects. Here, we compare HDCs and proteomic profiles of 50 patients experiencing joint-inflammatory symptoms, 27 of which were clinically diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The HDC of all 50 subjects appeared significantly different from expected healthy curves, but comparison of additional differences between the RA and the non-RA subjects allowed more specific understanding of RA samples. We used mass spectrometry (MS) to investigate the reasons behind the additional HDC changes observed in RA patients. The HDC differences do not appear to be directly related to differences in the concentrations of abundant serum proteins. Rather, the differences can be attributed to modified thermal stability of some fraction of the human serum albumin (HSA) proteins in the sample. By quantifying differences in the frequency of artificially induced post translational modifications (PTMs), we found that HSA in RA subjects had a much lower surface accessibility, indicating potential ligand or protein binding partners in certain regions that could explain the shift in HSA melting temperature in the RA HDCs. Several low abundance proteins were found to have significant changes in concentration in RA subjects and could be involved in or related to binding of HSA. Certain amino acid sites clusters were found to be less accessible in RA subjects, suggesting changes in HSA structure that may be related to changes in protein-protein interactions. These results all support a change in behavior of HSA which may give insight into mechanisms of RA pathology.","We gratefully acknowledge ARUP laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT) for providing anonymized serum samples after the RA panel was finalized; TA Instruments Application lab (Lindon, UT) for access to the DSC instrumentation and expertise.","BYU undergraduate research awards (https://www.chem.byu.edu/undergraduatestudents/undergraduate-esearch/ura/) supported JCH, WCT, DHP, MH, SA, NRZ.

Native AMPARs are multiprotein assemblies comprised of a tetrameric receptor core that co-assembles with a broad range of peripheral auxiliary proteins which shape subcellular localization and signaling properties of the resulting complexes. Structure determination of AMPARs has traditionally relied on recombinant expression systems; however, these methods are not well suited to elucidate the diverse array of AMPAR assemblies that are differentially expressed in mammalian brains. While recent studies of native receptor complexes have advanced our understanding of endogenous assemblies, receptors thus far have only been isolated from rodent brain tissue. Here, we employed an immunoaffinity purification strategy to isolate native AMPARs from the brains of three different mammals-pigs, sheep, and cows. Compared to rodents, pigs, sheep, and cows are ungulate mammals, animals with closer genomic identity with humans. Here we determined the molecular size, overall yield, and purity of native AMPARs isolated from these three mammals, thereby demonstrating that structural determination and biochemical analysis is possible from a clade of mammals evolutionarily distinct from rodents.","We thank Dr. Charles Roselli for donating sheep brains, Dr. John Williams and members of his lab for donating rodent carcasses, Aaron Silverman and Tails &amp; Trotters for dissecting pig brains, T.

Some experts advocate for financial incentives. Others argue that financial incentives, especially large ones, will have counterproductive psychological effects, reducing the percent of people who want to vaccinate. Among a racially and ethnically diverse U.S. sample of lower income adults, for whom vaccine uptake has lagged compared with higher income adults, we empirically examine such claims about relatively large and small guaranteed cash payments.
METHODS: In 2021, we conducted a randomized, controlled experiment among U.S. residents with incomes below $80,000 who reported being unvaccinated against COVID-19. Study participants were randomized to one of four study arms. In two arms, respondents first learned about a policy proposal to pay $1,000 or $200 to those who received COVID-19 vaccination and were then asked if, given that policy, they would want to vaccinate. In the two other arms, respondents received either an educational message about this vaccine or received no vaccine information and were then asked if they wanted to vaccinate for COVID-19. The primary analyses estimated and compared the overall percentage in each study arm that reported wanting to vaccinate for COVID-19. In other analyses, we estimated and compared these percentages for subgroups of interest, including gender, race/ethnicity, and education.
MAIN RESULTS: Among 2,290 unvaccinated adults, 79.7% (95%CI, 76.4-83.0%) of those who learned about the proposed $1,000 payment wanted to get vaccinated, compared with 58.9% (95%CI, 54.8-63.0%) in the control condition without vaccine information, a difference of 20 percentage points. Among those who learned of the proposed $200 payment, 74.8% (95% CI, 71.3-78.4%) wanted to vaccinate. Among those who learned only about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, 68.9% (95% CI, 65.1-72.7%) wanted to vaccinate. Findings were consistent across various subgroups.
DISCUSSION: Despite several study limitations, the results do not support concerns that the financial incentive policies aimed to increase COVID-19 vaccination would have counterproductive effects. Instead, those who learned about a policy with a large or small financial incentive were more likely than those in the control condition to report that they would want to vaccinate. The positive effects extended to subgroups that have been less likely to vaccinate, including younger adults, those with less education, and racial and ethnic minorities. Financial incentives of $1,000 performed similarly to those offering only $200.","We appreciate the insightful responses from members of the World Bank and domestic public health government agencies who commented on a presentation of the results and discussed implications.

METHODS: The study period was December 2020-November 2021. Overall, 65 students attended a lecture on lung auscultation featuring a simulator (Mr. Lung™). Among them, 35 (visualization group) received additional training wherein they were asked to mentally visualize lung sounds using a graphical visualized lung sounds diagram as an example. All students answered questions on their self-efficacy regarding lung auscultation before and after four weeks of CC. They also took a lung auscultation test with the simulator at the beginning of CC (pre-test) and on the last day of the third week (post-test) (maximum score: 25). We compared the answers in the questionnaire and the test scores between the visualization group and students who only attended the lecture (control group, n = 30). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and analysis of covariance were used to compare the answers to the questionnaire about confidence in lung auscultation and the scores of the lung auscultation tests before and after the training.
RESULTS: Confidence in auscultation of lung sounds significantly increased in both groups (five-point Likert scale, visualization group: pre-questionnaire median 1 [Interquartile range 1] to post-questionnaire 3 [1], p<0.001; control group: 2 [1] to 3 [1], p<0.001) and was significantly higher in the visualization than in the control group. Test scores increased in both groups (visualization group: pre-test 11 [2] to post-test 15 [4], p<0.001; control group: 11 [5] to 14 [4], p<0.001). However, there were no differences between both groups' pre and post-tests scores (p = 0.623).
CONCLUSION: Visualizing lung sounds may increase medical students' confidence in their lung auscultation skills; this may reduce their resistance to lung auscultation and encourage the repeated auscultation necessary to further improve their long-term auscultation abilities.",We would like to thank Editage (www.editage.com) for English language editing.,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,"Humans; Respiratory Sounds; Clinical Clerkship; Auscultation; Lung; Students, Medical; Clinical Competence; Heart Auscultation",2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,,18,3,e0282337,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kuriyama, Ayaka; Kasai, Hajime; Shikino, Kiyoshi; Shiko, Yuki; Kawame, Chiaki; Takeda, Kenichiro; Tajima, Hiroshi; Hayama, Nami; Suzuki, Takuji; Ito, Shoichi","Kuriyama, Ayaka (Department of Respirology, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan); Kasai, Hajime (Department of Respirology, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan; Health Professional Development Center, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan; Department of Medical Education, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan); Shikino, Kiyoshi (Department of General Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan); Shiko, Yuki (Biostatistics Section, Clinical Research Center, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan); Kawame, Chiaki (Department of Respirology, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan); Takeda, Kenichiro (Department of Respirology, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan; Health Professional Development Center, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan); Tajima, Hiroshi (Department of Respirology, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan; Department of Medical Education, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan); Hayama, Nami (Department of Respirology, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan); Suzuki, Takuji (Department of Respirology, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan); Ito, Shoichi (Health Professional Development Center, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan; Department of Medical Education, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan)","Kasai, Hajime (Chiba University; Chiba University Hospital; Chiba University)","Kuriyama, Ayaka (Chiba University); Kasai, Hajime (Chiba University; Chiba University Hospital; Chiba University); Shikino, Kiyoshi (Chiba University); Shiko, Yuki (Chiba University Hospital); Kawame, Chiaki (Chiba University); Takeda, Kenichiro (Chiba University; Chiba University Hospital); Tajima, Hiroshi (Chiba University; Chiba University); Hayama, Nami (Chiba University); Suzuki, Takuji (Chiba University); Ito, Shoichi (Chiba University Hospital; Chiba University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282337&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156292005,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

In this letter, we propose a new method to approach the positive and biased negative (PbN) classification problem, which is a weakly supervised learning method to learn a binary classifier from positive data and negative data with biased observations. We incorporate a method to correct the negative influence due to a skewed confidence, which is represented by the posterior probability that the observed data are positive. This reduces the distortion of the posterior probability that the data are labeled, which is necessary for the empirical risk minimization of the PbN classification problem.

In Australia, a lack of specific legislation articulating protest rights has meant that, in the context of pandemic restrictions, such events have been treated as illegal mass gatherings. Numerous large protests in major cities have, indeed, stirred significant public debate regarding rights of assembly during COVID-19 outbreaks. The ethics of infringing on protest rights continues to be controversial, with opinion divided as to whether public health goals or human rights should take precedence. This paper applies public health ethical theory to an in-depth analysis of arguments on both sides of the debate. Using the Nuffield Council on Bioethics framework as a backdrop, proportionality and necessity of restrictions are understood as key concepts that are common to both public health and human rights perspectives. The analysis presented here finds a middle-ground between the prevailing arguments on opposing sides and is further able to rationalize the use of protest itself as an important element of a mature public health ethics response to restrictive policy. Thus, this paper aims to influence public health policy and legislation regarding protest rights during public health emergencies.",,Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions,Journal of Bioethical Inquiry,,,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,2023-03-16,,,1-8,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Wood, Stephanie L.","Wood, Stephanie L.

Existing therapies provide modest improvements in patient survival, raising a need for new treatments for ALS. Zebrafish is a promising model animal for translational and fundamental research in ALS - it is an experimentally tractable vertebrate, with high homology to humans and an ample experimental toolbox. These advantages allow high-throughput study of behavioral and pathophysiological phenotypes. The last decade saw an increased interest in modelling ALS in zebrafish, leading to the current abundance and variety of available methods and models. Additionally, the rise of gene editing techniques and toxin combination studies has created novel opportunities for ALS studies in zebrafish. In this review, we address the relevance of zebrafish as a model animal for ALS studies, the strategies for model induction and key phenotypical evaluation. Furthermore, we discuss established and emerging zebrafish models of ALS, analyzing their validity, including their potential for drug testing, and highlighting research opportunities in this area.","Acknowledgements Work in the laboratory of J.

Noise reduction, identified as a potential added benefit of the retrofitting effort, was investigated in this study. A passive acoustic recording dataset from the Santa Barbara Channel off Southern California was used to compile over 100 opportunistic vessel transits of the twelve G-Class container ships, pre- and post-retrofit. Post-retrofit, the G-Class vessels' capacity was increased from ~9,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) to ~11,000 TEUs, which required a draft increase of the vessel by 1.5 m on average. The increased vessel draft resulted in higher radiated noise levels (<2 dB) in the mid- and high-frequency bands. Accounting for the Lloyd's mirror (dipole source) effect, the monopole source levels of the post-retrofit ships were found to be significantly lower (>5 dB) than the pre-retrofit ships in the low-frequency band and the reduction was greatest at low speed. Although multiple design changes occurred during retrofitting, the reduction in the low-frequency band most likely results from a reduction in cavitation due to changes in propeller and bow design.","We thank Leila Hatch, Michael Jasny, Patrick Ramage, Caroline Coogan and Mark Spaulding for their support.

Yet COVID-19 testing and estimates of the infectious period remain largely based on nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs. We sought to evaluate whether saliva testing captured prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 and potential infectiousness later in the disease course. We conducted an observational study of symptomatic COVID-19 patients at University Hospital in Newark, NJ. Paired saliva and nasal specimens from 96 patients were analyzed, including longitudinal analysis of paired observations from 28 of these patients who had multiple time-points. Saliva detected significantly more cases of COVID-19 beyond 5 days (86.1% [99/115] saliva vs 48.7% [56/115] nasal, p-value < 0.001), 9 days (79.4% [50/63] saliva vs 36.5% [23/63] nasal, p-value < 0.001) and 14 days (71.4% [20/28] saliva vs 32.1% [9/28] nasal, p-value = 0.010) of symptoms. Additionally, saliva yielded lower cycle thresholds across all time periods, indicative of higher viral loads in saliva. In the longitudinal analysis, a log-rank analysis indicated that the survival curve for saliva was significantly different from the curve for nasal swabs (p<0.001) with a median survival time for saliva of 18 days compared to 13 days for nasal swabs. We additionally performed saliva viral cultures among a similar COVID-19 patient cohort and noted patients with positive saliva viral cultures between 7 to 28 days of symptoms. Findings from this study suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RNA persists longer and in higher abundance in saliva compared to nasal swabs, with potential of prolonged propagating virus. Testing saliva may thus increase yield for detecting potentially infectious virus even beyond the first five days of symptomatic COVID-19.",,"This study was partially funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases under award number R01 AI131617 (Alland) and the Rutgers University Center for COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness (Xie).

AIMS: We aimed to describe the detailed clinical course of delirium and related cognitive functioning in geriatric patients in a mainly non-postoperative setting in association with demographic and clinical parameters and additionally to identify risk factors for delirium in this common setting.
METHODS: Inpatients of a geriatric ward were screened for delirium and in the case of presence of delirium included into the study. Patients received three assessments including Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) and the Delirium Rating Scale Revised 98 (DRS-R-98). We conducted correlation and linear mixed-effects model analyses to detect associations.
RESULTS: Overall 31 patients (82 years (mean)) met the criteria for delirium and were included in the prospective observational study. Within one week of treatment, mean delirium symptom severity fell below the predefined cut-off. While overall cognitive functioning improved over time, short- and long-term memory deficits remained. Neuroradiological conspicuities were associated with cognitive deficits, but not with delirium severity.
DISCUSSION: The temporal stability of some delirium symptoms (short-/long-term memory, language) on the one hand and on the other hand decrease in others (hallucinations, orientation) shown in our study visualizes the heterogeneity of symptoms attributed to delirium and their different courses, which complicates the differentiation between delirium and a preexisting cognitive decline. The recovery from delirium seems to be independent of preclinical cognitive status.
CONCLUSION: Treatment of the acute medical condition is associated with a fast decrease in delirium severity. Given the high incidence and prevalence of delirium in hospitalized older patients and its detrimental impact on cognition, abilities and personal independence further research needs to be done.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Humans; Aged; Delirium; Inpatients; Cognition Disorders; Cognitive Dysfunction; Risk Factors; Geriatric Assessment,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0279763,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wilke, Skadi; Steiger, Edgar; Bärwolff, Tanja L.; Kleine, Justus F.; Müller-Werdan, Ursula; Rosada, Adrian","Wilke, Skadi (Department of Geriatrics, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany); Steiger, Edgar (Central Research Institute of Ambulatory Health Care in Germany (Zi), Berlin, Germany); Bärwolff, Tanja L.

These complications are functions of the experimental parameters in these systems, such as the Cas9 cutting rate, the diversity of indel outcomes, and the rate of missing data. In this paper, we develop two theoretically grounded algorithms for the reconstruction of the underlying single-cell phylogenetic tree as well as asymptotic bounds for the number of recording sites necessary for exact recapitulation of the ground truth phylogeny at high probability. In doing so, we explore the relationship between the problem difficulty and the experimental parameters, with implications for experimental design. Lastly, we provide simulations showing the empirical performance of these algorithms and showing that the trends in the asymptotic bounds hold empirically. Overall, this work provides a theoretical analysis of phylogenetic reconstruction in single-cell CRISPR-Cas9 lineage-tracing technologies.","We acknowledge Matt Jones for valuable feedback on the introduction and discussion sections.

It is mistakenly assumed that adults can swallow solid oral dosage forms (SODFs, e.g. tablets/capsules colloquially referred to as 'pills'), without difficulty and that children cannot. KidzMed is a 'pill swallowing' training programme designed to teach effective SODF use in patients of all ages. It may be utilised by healthcare professionals to assist patients taking SODFs. E-learning was essential for training during COVID pandemic to reduce viral transmission. The aim of this study was to explore UK student pharmacists views of e-learning to support swallowing solid oral dosage forms.
METHODS: This study used pre- and post-intervention online surveys on Microsoft Forms to evaluate self-directed eLearning about pill swallowing on MPharm programmes at three UK Universities using a 13-item survey. A combination of five-point Likert Scales and free-text items were used. The eLearning was available via the virtual learning environment at the University and embedded within existing curriculum. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to explore responses.
RESULTS: In total, 113 of 340 (33%) students completed the survey. Seventy-eight percent (n = 65) reported the eLearning would enable them to teach adults and children to swallow SODFs successfully. Learners either agreed or strongly agreed that they felt comfortable to teach patients (95%, n = 62/113) and parents or carers (94%, n = 60) to swallow medications having completed the e-learning. Student pharmacists generally found eLearning as an acceptable way to reflect on their own experiences of 'pill' swallowing and how to support patients to swallow SODFs.
CONCLUSION: The KidzMed eLearning was well received by student pharmacists.

Later, Dai (2016) pointed out abnormality in the convergence result and thus, imposed certain restricted RMIL CG parameter as a remedy. In this paper, we suggest an efficient RMIL spectral CG method. The remarkable feature of this method is that, the convergence result is free from additional condition usually imposed on RMIL. Subsequently, the search direction is sufficiently descent independent of any line search technique. Thus, numerical experiments on some set of benchmark problems indicate that the method is promising and efficient. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated on applications arising from arm robotic model and image restoration problems.","The authors acknowledge the support provided by the Petchra Pra Jom Klao Scholarship of King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi (Contract No. 52/2564), Center of Excellence in Theoretical and Computational Science (TaCS-CoE), KMUTT and King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok (Contract No. KMUTNB-FF-66-36).",The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Algorithms; Robotic Surgical Procedures,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0281250,All OA; Gold,Article,"Salihu, Nasiru; Kumam, Poom; Awwal, Aliyu Muhammed; Sulaiman, Ibrahim Mohammed; Seangwattana, Thidaporn","Salihu, Nasiru (Center of Excellence in Theoretical and Computational Science, Fixed Point Research Laboratory, Fixed Point Theory and Applications Research Group, Faculty of Science, King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand; Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Sciences, Modibbo Adama University, Yola, Nigeria; Gombe State University Mathematics for Innovative Research Group, Gombe State University, Gombe, Nigeria); Kumam, Poom (Center of Excellence in Theoretical and Computational Science, Fixed Point Research Laboratory, Fixed Point Theory and Applications Research Group, Faculty of Science, King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand; KMUTT-Fixed Point Research Laboratory, Science Laboratory Building, Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand; Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan); Awwal, Aliyu Muhammed (Center of Excellence in Theoretical and Computational Science, Fixed Point Research Laboratory, Fixed Point Theory and Applications Research Group, Faculty of Science, King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand; Gombe State University Mathematics for Innovative Research Group, Gombe State University, Gombe, Nigeria; Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Gombe State University, Gombe, Nigeria); Sulaiman, Ibrahim Mohammed (School of Quantitative Sciences, Universiti Utara Malaysia, UUM Sintok, Kedah, Malaysia; Institute of Strategic Industrial Decision Modelling, Universiti Utara Malaysia, Sintok, Kedah, Malaysia); Seangwattana, Thidaporn (Faculty of Science Energy and Environment, King Mongkut’s University of Technology, North Bangkok, Rayong Campus, Rayong, Thailand)","Kumam, Poom (King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi; King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi; )","Salihu, Nasiru (King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi; Gombe State University); Kumam, Poom (King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi; King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi); Awwal, Aliyu Muhammed (King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi; Gombe State University; Gombe State University); Sulaiman, Ibrahim Mohammed (Northern University of Malaysia; Northern University of Malaysia); Seangwattana, Thidaporn (King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281250&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156250946,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics; 4903 Numerical and Computational Mathematics,

The actual number of offspring is also subject to demographic stochasticity-that is, randomness associated with birth and death processes. In nature, individuals who are more fecund tend to have greater variance in their offspring number. Here, we develop a model for the evolution of two types competing in a population of nonconstant size. The fitness of each type is determined by pairwise interactions in a prisoner's dilemma game, and the variance in offspring number depends upon its mean. Although defectors are preferred by natural selection in classical population models, since they always have greater fitness than cooperators, we show that sufficiently large offspring variance can reverse the direction of evolution and favor cooperation. Large offspring variance produces qualitatively new dynamics for other types of social interactions, as well, which cannot arise in populations with a fixed size or with a Poisson offspring distribution.","We thank the anonymous referees for their constructive input.

Here, we use machine learning on the full information available in fluorescent excitation/emission spectra of amyloid-binding dyes to identify six distinct different conformational strains in vitro, as well as amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits in different transgenic mouse models. Our EMBER (excitation multiplexed bright emission recording) imaging method rapidly identifies conformational differences in Aβ and tau deposits from Down syndrome, sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease human brain slices. EMBER has in situ identified distinct conformational strains of tau inclusions in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons from Pick's disease. In future studies, EMBER should enable high-throughput measurements of the fidelity of strain transmission in cellular and animal neurodegenerative diseases models, time course of amyloid strain propagation, and identification of pathogenic versus benign strains.","This work was supported by the NIH (AG061874 and AG002132).

Its main purpose is to encourage the recipient to engage with their general practitioner or diabetic nurse in order that improvements in medical management of their diabetes may be made, thereby reducing their risk of recurrent hypoglycaemia. Herein we build a de novo economic model for purposes of incremental analyses to compare, in 2018-19 prices, HS2 against standard care for recurrent hypoglycaemia in the fortnight following the initial attack from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). We found that per patient NHS costs incurred by people receiving the HS2 intervention over the fortnight following an initial hypoglycaemia average £49.79, and under standard care costs average £40.50. Target patient benefit assessed over that same period finds the probability of no recurrence of hypoglycaemia averaging 42.4% under HS2 and 39.4% under standard care, a 7.6% reduction in relative risk. We find that implementing HS2 will cost the NHS an additional £309.36 per episode of recurrent hypoglycaemia avoided. Contrary to the favourable support offered in Botan et al., we conclude that in its current form the HS2 intervention is not a cost-effective use of NHS resources when compared to standard NHS care in reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia recurring within a fortnight of an initial attack that was resolved at-scene by EMS ambulance clinicians.",,"The study was funded by NIHR Applied Research Collaboration (ARC) East Midlands, UK.

The pathway analysis is a de facto standard downstream analysis procedure in most genomic and transcriptomic studies. Here, we present MOPA (Multi-Omics Pathway Analysis), which is a multi-omics integrative method that scores individual pathways in a sample wise manner in terms of enriched multi-omics regulatory activity, which we refer to mES (multi-omics Enrichment Score). The mES score reflects the strength of regulatory relations between multi-omics in units of pathways. In addition, MOPA is able to measure how much each omics contribute to mES that may be used to observe what kind of omics are active in a pathway within a sample group (e.g., subtype, gender), which we refer to OCR (Omics Contribution Rate). Using nine different cancer types, 93 clinical features and three types of omics (i.e., gene expression, miRNA and methylation), MOPA was used to search for clinical features that were explainable in context of multi-omics. By evaluating the performance of MOPA, we showed that it yielded higher or at least equal performance compared to previous single and multi-omics pathway analysis tools. We find that the advantage of MOPA is the ability to explain pathways in terms of omics relation using mES and OCR. As one of the results, the TGF-beta signaling pathway was captured as an important pathway that showed distinct mES and OCR values specific to the CMS4 subtype in colon adenocarcinoma. The mES and OCR metrics suggested that the mRNA and miRNA expressions were significantly different from the other subtypes, which was concordant with previous studies.

The etiology and pathogenesis of RA and SLE are interconnected in several ways, with limited knowledge about the underlying molecular mechanisms. With the motivation to better understand shared biological mechanisms and determine novel therapeutic targets, we explored common molecular disease signatures by performing a meta-analysis of publicly available microarray gene expression datasets of RA and SLE. We performed an integrated, multi-cohort analysis of 1088 transcriptomic profiles from 14 independent studies to identify common gene signatures. We identified sixty-two genes common among RA and SLE, out of which fifty-nine genes (21 upregulated and 38 downregulated) had similar expression profiles in the diseases. However, antagonistic expression profiles were observed for ACVR2A, FAM135A, and MAPRE1 genes. Thirty genes common between RA and SLE were proposed as robust gene signatures, with persistent expression in all the studies and cell types. These gene signatures were found to be involved in innate as well as adaptive immune responses, bone development and growth. In conclusion, our analysis of multicohort and multiple microarray datasets would provide the basis for understanding the common mechanisms of pathogenesis and exploring these gene signatures for their diagnostic and therapeutic potential.","We acknowledge ICGEB for providing the necessary infrastructure and facilities for the research.

Determining the relative hazard of these compounds to non-target bird species is an important component of ecological risks evaluation. Problematically, some potential non-target bird species may be as small as 10 g in body mass, thus placing limitations on blood volumes that can be routinely sampled. Accordingly, we developed methods to quantify markers of increasing methaemoglobinaemia at their point of collection that required only 5 μL of whole blood. A 3 μL blood aliquot is pipetted into a plastic micro-cuvette and placed in a custom made holder optically coupled to the Ocean Optics spectrometer, enabling absorbance for oxyhaemoglobin (HbO: 575 nm) and MetHb (630 nm) to be determined. Haemoglobin (HbFe2+), packed cell volume (PCV) and lactate (LAC) data were generated from the remaining 2 μL aliquot apportioned to biosensor strips for the Cera-Check® and Lactate Scout® point-of-care devices. After oral doses of PAPP, a methaemoglobinaemia absorbance index (MAI = absorbance 575 nm-absorbance 630 nm) was strongly and significantly associated with dose-dependent declines in HbFe2+ in 9 bird species. Quantifying dose-dependent responses to MetHb-forming agents at the point of sample collection avoids analytical and storage artifacts arising from sample degradation that appears to be a much greater problem in avian blood compared to mammalian blood.","The authors wish to thank the Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research (MWLR) Animal facility staff for husbandry of domestic and wild birds, and MWLR field staff for capture of wild birds; Kate McInnes and Lydia Uddstrom (DOC veterinarians) for helping develop and refine the methodology for native species; The Takahē team, particularly the staff and vet at the Burwood Takahē Centre and the staff at the Dunedin Wildlife Hospital for their invaluable assistance; Te Kaitiaki Rōpū O Murihiku (Kākāpō/ Takahē Iwi advisory board) for supporting this work; The Otorohanga Kiwi House management, staff and attending vet, for their commitment and assistance; and Ngāti Hinewai kaumatua for supporting the research; The Kiwi and Weka recovery groups (DOC); and the NZ Zoo and Aquarium Association for facilitating contact with the captive facilities.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to assess CRF is the gold standard for preoperative risk assessment. To aid interpretation of raw breath-by-breath data, different methods of data-averaging can be applied. This study aimed to investigate the influence of different data-averaging intervals on CPET variables used for preoperative risk assessment, as well as to evaluate whether different data-averaging intervals influence preoperative risk assessment.
METHODS: A total of 21 preoperative CPETs were interpreted by two exercise physiologists using stationary time-based data-averaging intervals of 10, 20, and 30 seconds and rolling average intervals of 3 and 7 breaths. Mean values of CPET variables between different data averaging intervals were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. The variables of interest were oxygen uptake at peak exercise (VO2peak), oxygen uptake at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VO2VAT), oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES), the ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VE/VCO2VAT), and the slope of the relationship between the minute ventilation and carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2-slope).
RESULTS: Between data-averaging intervals, no statistically significant differences were found in the mean values of CPET variables except for the ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold (P = 0.001). No statistically significant differences were found in the proportion of patients classified as high or low risk regardless of the used data-averaging interval.
CONCLUSION: There appears to be no significant or clinically relevant influence of the evaluated data-averaging intervals on the mean values of CPET outcomes used for preoperative risk assessment. Clinicians may choose a data-averaging interval that is appropriate for optimal interpretation and data visualization of the preoperative CPET. Nevertheless, caution should be taken as the chosen data-averaging interval might lead to substantial within-patient variation for individual patients.

Characterizing population structure is important for the effective management of exploited species, as it can be used to identify appropriate scales of management in fishery and aquaculture contexts. The California sea cucumber, Apostichopus californicus, is one such exploited species whose management could benefit from further characterization of population structure. Using restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, we developed 2075 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to quantify genetic structure over a broad section of the species' range along the North American west coast and within the Salish Sea, a region supporting the Washington State A. californicus fishery and developing aquaculture production of the species. We found evidence for population structure (global fixation index (FST) = 0.0068) with limited dispersal driving two patterns of differentiation: isolation-by-distance and a latitudinal gradient of differentiation. Notably, we found detectable population differences among collection sites within the Salish Sea (pairwise FST = 0.001-0.006). Using FST outlier detection and gene-environment association, we identified 10.2% of total SNPs as putatively adaptive. Environmental variables (e.g., temperature, salinity) from the sea surface were more correlated with genetic variation than those same variables measured near the benthos, suggesting that selection on pelagic larvae may drive adaptive differentiation to a greater degree than selection on adults. Our results were consistent with previous estimates of and patterns in population structure for this species in other extents of the range. Additionally, we found that patterns of neutral and adaptive differentiation co-varied, suggesting that adaptive barriers may limit dispersal.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between food consumption diversity and nutritional status among children aged 6-23 months in Indonesia.
METHODS: The data used came from the results of the 2018 Basic Health Research. The main independent variable was the diversity of food consumption. Control variables included breastfeeding practices and demographic and socioeconomic factors. Using ordinal logistic regression, the role of food consumption diversity in influencing nutritional status was examined after controlling for breastfeeding practices and demographic and socioeconomic factors.
RESULTS: The results of the study showed that the diversity of food consumption (AOR = 1.15; 95%CI: 1.07-1.24) significantly and statistically influenced nutritional status of children age 6-23 months in Indonesia even after controlling for the effects of breastfeeding practices and demographic and socioeconomic factors. Higher odds of having normal nutritional status compared to being stunted or severely stunted was associated with consuming food according to the dietary diversity. Higher odds of having normal nutritional status compared to being stunted or severely stunted was also significantly and statistically associated with being ever breastfed (AOR = 1.33; 95%CI: 1.22-1.46), aged 6-11 months (AOR = 3.07; 95%CI: 2.79-3.38), female (AOR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.25-1.46), children of non-working mothers (AOR = 1.12; 95%CI: 1.04-1.21), children of higher educated mothers (AOR = 1.50; 95%CI: 1.30-1.72), children from higher wealth quintile households (AOR = 1.65; 95%CI: 1.44-1.85), children from smaller size family (AOR = 1.07; 95%CI: 1.05-1.10), and urban children (AOR = 1.16; 95%CI:1.08-1.25).
CONCLUSION: A profound percentage of children aged 6-23 months in Indonesia experienced stunting and severely stunting. Children who did not receive minimum dietary diversity were more likely to suffer from stunting. The findings from this study suggest that to ensure the achievement of national goal of preventing stunting and sustainable development goal of ending all forms of malnutrition in Indonesia, the strategy should promote the fulfillment of minimum food consumption diversity.",,"This research was supported by the Government of Indonesia, which provided for funding for this research project through the Ministry of Research and Technology/National Research and Innovation Board Fiscal Year 2021 (No.: NKB-006/UN2.RST/HKP.05.00/2021).

Stepped care models (SCM) and culturally sensitive therapies offer promising treatment approaches to effectively provide necessary medical and psychological support. To our knowledge, we were the first to investigate whether a culturally sensitive SCM will reduce symptoms of depression and PTSD in ARAS more effectively and efficiently than treatment as usual (TAU). We conducted a multicentric, randomized, controlled and rater-blinded trial across Germany with ARAS between the ages of 14 to 21 years. Participants (N = 158) were stratified by their level of depressive symptom severity and then equally randomized to either SCM or TAU. Depending on their severity level, SCM participants were allocated to tailored interventions. Symptom changes were assessed for depression (PHQ) and PTSD (CATS) at four time points, with the primary end point at post-intervention after 12 weeks. Based on an intention-to-treat sample, we used a linear mixed model approach for the main statistical analyses. Further evaluations included cost–utility analyses, sensitivity analyses, follow-up-analyses, response and remission rates and subgroup analysis. We found a significant reduction of PHQ (d = 0.52) and CATS (d = 0.27) scores in both groups. However, there was no significant difference between SCM and TAU. Cost–utility analyses indicated that SCM generated greater cost–utility when measured as quality-adjusted life years compared to TAU. Subgroup analysis revealed different effects for the SCM interventions depending on the outcome measure. Although culturally sensitive, SCMs did not prove to be more effective in symptom change and represent a more cost-effective treatment alternative for mentally burdened ARAS. Our research contributes to the optimization of clinical productivity and the improvement of therapeutic care for ARAS. Disorder-specific interventions should be further investigated.","The authors thank all members of the steering committee for taking part in the trial.

However, the causality between LSB/PA and musculoskeletal health remained unknown. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the causal relationships between LSB/PA and lower back pain (LBP), intervertebral disc disorder (IVDD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and bone mineral density (BMD) by using a two-sample Mendelian randomization method.
METHODS: The exposure data were obtained from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including the PA dataset (self-reported PA, n  =  377,234; accelerometer-assessed PA, n  = 91,084) and LSB dataset (n  =  422,218). The outcome data were derived from the FinnGen LBP dataset (n  =  248,528), FinnGen IVDD dataset (n  =  256,896), BMD GWAS dataset (n  =  56,284), and RA GWAS dataset (n  =  58,284). The causal relationships were estimated with inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median methods. Sensitivity analyses were performed with Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and leave-one-out analysis to estimate the robustness of our findings.
RESULTS: Genetically predicted leisure television watching increased the risk of LBP (OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.01; P = 8.23×10-9) and IVDD (OR  =  1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.91; P  =  2.13 × 10-8). In addition, this study revealed a potential causal relationship between computer use and a reduced risk of IVDD (OR  = 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.86; P  =  0.005) and RA (OR  = 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.60; P  =  0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that leisure television watching is a risk factor for LBP and IVDD, whereas leisure computer use may act as a protective factor against IVDD and RA.

The objective of the current study was to define sequence of such alterations in with establishing blast-induced lung injury in rats using an advanced blast generator.
METHODS: Rats underwent a standardized blast wave trauma and were euthanised at defined time points. Non-traumatised animals served as sham controls. Obtained samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at each time-point were assessed for histology, leukocyte infiltration and cytokine/chemokine profile.
RESULTS: After blast lung injury, significant haemorrhage and neutrophil infiltration were observed. Similarly, protein accumulation, lactate dehydrogenase activity (LDH), alveolar eicosanoid release, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9, pro-Inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL) -6 raised up. While declining in the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 occurred. Ultimately, pulmonary oedema developed that increased to its maximum level within the first 1.5 h, then recovered within 24 h.
CONCLUSION: Using a stablished model, can facilitate the study of inflammatory response to blast lung injury. Following the blast injury, alteration in cytokine/chemokine profile and activity of cells in the alveolar space occurs, which eventuates in alveolar epithelial barrier dysfunction and oedema formation. Most of these parameters exhibit time-dependent return to their basal status that is an indication to resilience of lungs to blast-induced lung injury.","This work has mainly been performed by Dr. Katja Eichert as work on her thesis; all authors highly acknowledge her work for this paper.

Here, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a novel artificial intelligence-based automated pneumonia detection method using point-of-care lung ultrasound (AI-POCUS) for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
METHODS: We enrolled consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19 who underwent computed tomography (CT) in August and September 2021. A 12-zone AI-POCUS was performed by a novice observer using a pocket-size device within 24 h of the CT scan. Fifteen control subjects were also scanned. Additionally, the accuracy of the simplified 8-zone scan excluding the dorsal chest, was assessed. More than three B-lines detected in one lung zone were considered zone-level positive, and the presence of positive AI-POCUS in any lung zone was considered patient-level positive. The sample size calculation was not performed given the retrospective all-comer nature of the study.
RESULTS: A total of 577 lung zones from 56 subjects (59.4 ± 14.8 years, 23% female) were evaluated using AI-POCUS. The mean number of days from disease onset was 9, and 14% of patients were under mechanical ventilation. The CT-validated pneumonia was seen in 71.4% of patients at total 577 lung zones (53.3%). The 12-zone AI-POCUS for detecting CT-validated pneumonia in the patient-level showed the accuracy of 94.5% (85.1%- 98.1%), sensitivity of 92.3% (79.7%- 97.3%), specificity of 100% (80.6%- 100%), positive predictive value of 95.0% (89.6% - 97.7%), and Kappa of 0.33 (0.27-0.40). When simplified with 8-zone scan, the accuracy, sensitivity, and sensitivity were 83.9% (72.2%- 91.3%), 77.5% (62.5%- 87.7%), and 100% (80.6%- 100%), respectively. The zone-level accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of AI-POCUS were 65.3% (61.4%- 69.1%), 37.2% (32.0%- 42.7%), and 97.8% (95.2%- 99.0%), respectively.

However, current medical NLP systems fall considerably short when faced with the task of logically interpreting clinical text. In this paper, we describe a framework inspired by mechanisms of human cognition in an attempt to jump the NLP performance curve. The design centers on a hierarchical semantic compositional model (HSCM), which provides an internal substrate for guiding the interpretation process. The paper describes insights from four key cognitive aspects: semantic memory, semantic composition, semantic activation, and hierarchical predictive coding.

To date, however, no RCTs have been conducted to compare TD-CBT to another active intervention in this setting. Our aim is to conduct a single-blind RCT to compare group TD-CBT plus TAU to progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) plus TAU in adults (age 18 to 65 years) with a suspected emotional disorder. We expect that TD-CBT + TAU will be more cost-effective than TAU + PMR, and that these gains will be maintained at the 12-month follow-up. Seven therapy sessions (1.5 hours each) will be offered over a 24-week period. The study will be carried out at four primary care centres in Cantabria, Spain. The study will take a societal perspective. Psychological assessments will be made at three time points: baseline, post-treatment, and at 12-months. The following variables will be evaluated: clinical symptoms (anxiety, depression, and/or somatic); functioning; quality of life (QoL); cognitive-emotional factors (rumination, worry, attentional and interpretative biases, emotion regulation and meta-cognitive beliefs); and satisfaction with treatment. Data on health service use, medications, and sick days will be obtained from electronic medical records. Primary outcome measures will include: incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs). Secondary outcome measures will include: clinical symptoms, QoL, functioning, and treatment satisfaction. Bootstrap sampling will be used to assess uncertainty of the results. Secondary moderation and mediation analyses will be conducted. Two questionnaires will be administered at sessions 1, 4, and 7 to assess therapeutic alliance and group satisfaction. If this trial is successful, widespread application of this cost-effective treatment could greatly improve access to psychological treatment for emotional disorders in the context of increasing demand for mental healthcare in primary care.

The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluation of fecal calprotectin (CP) as a non-invasive biomarker for the evaluation of inflammation in patients with multiple myeloma. This study is a hospital-based case control study. MM patients referred to patients referred to medical centers of Tehran province, Iran, were identified and classified into two groups of new MM patients (n = 40) and patients undergoing treatment (n = 28). Healthy individuals were included in the study as healthy control (n = 25). Morning stool samples were collected and CP was extracted immediately. After collecting the samples, CP was measured according to ELISA method and was determined in μg/g of feces. Values ​​above 50 μg/g of feces are positive and indicate inflammation. The results revealed that there is a significant difference between groups in terms if CP mean (p = 0.001). The mean of CP among new cases, under treatment and control groups were 301.3 (SD: 141.0), 165.1 (SD: 153.9) and 36.9 (SD: 13.5), respectively. Then the groups were compared in pairs, the results showed that the new case group was significantly different from the under-treatment group (p = 0.001), and also the control group showed a significant difference with the new case group (p = 0.001) and the under-treatment group (p = 0.001) that the amount of CP in the control group was significantly lower than the other two groups. In addition, the results of the study showed a significant correlation between age and plasma cells with CP value, so that with increasing age and plasma cells, CP value also showed a significant increase. The results indicate that quantitative evaluation of CP as a non-invasive laboratory biomarker has a high potential as a clinical marker in patients with multiple myeloma and inflammation should considered as a hallmark of cancer.

In 2 randomized controlled trials (RCT), treatment improved negative symptoms of schizophrenia and social functioning among patients with moderate to severe negative symptoms. We report results of the protocol specified analysis of 2 open-label extension studies of 24 and 40 weeks investigating whether improvement of negative symptoms was sustained without significant adverse effects or worsening of psychosis. Following 12-week double-blind phase of both RCTs, patients were eligible to receive monotherapy roluperidone 32 mg/day or 64 mg/day for 24 weeks (trial 1) or 40 weeks (trial 2) in open-label extension study. Trial 1 included 244 patients of whom 142 entered 24-week open-label extension and trial 2 included 513 patients of whom 341 entered 40-week open-label extension. Trial 1 had PANSS negative factor score of Pentagonal Structure Model as primary outcome. Trial 2 had Marder Negative Symptoms Factor Score as primary outcome measure and Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Total score as secondary outcome. During open-label extensions, continued improvements in negative symptoms and on PSP were observed. Overall rate of symptomatic worsening requiring discontinuation of roluperidone and treatment with an antipsychotic was <10 %. Roluperidone was well tolerated with no meaningful changes in vital signs, laboratory values, weight gain, metabolic indices, or extrapyramidal symptoms. Results of 2 open-label extension trials support roluperidone as a treatment of negative symptoms and social functioning deficits in patients with moderate to severe negative symptoms of schizophrenia.","Declaration of competing interest Authors JR, MW, PH have received consultancy fees from Minerva Neurosciences.

Concerned governments, institutions, and actors concerned with addressing these issues must wrestle with complex systems that span time, space, and scale. This complexity of connected systems requires the participation of multiple actors across political boundaries, problem areas, and hydrologic domains. In Lake Champlain (US), frequent cyanobacteria blooms negatively affect property values, recreational activities, and public infrastructure, in addition to their impacts on the aquatic ecosystem. Through a survey of actors working on water quality in the Lake Champlain Basin, we analyze how actor participation in structured issue forums creates a network of connected action situations across multiple spatial scales and problem domains. We apply exponential random graph models to quantify the effects of scale, issues, and homophily on actor participation in these forums. Our findings show that actors tend to favor participating in similarly scoped forums at their spatial scale, that actors are less likely to participate in structured forums focused on agriculture, and that actors participate independently of others with whom they have pre-existing collaborative relationships. Further, we find that in the case of the Lake Champlain Basin, actor participation in issues related to water quality is misaligned with modeled sources of nutrient pollution. This study demonstrates that the design and maintenance of water quality action situations play an important role in attracting the participation of actors working collaboratively to address wicked social-ecological problems. Further, linking current and potential configurations of governance networks to social-ecological outcomes can aid in the effective and efficient achievement of management objectives.",,"PB and CK were supported by the National Science Foundation under VT EPSCoR Grant No. NSF OIA 1556770, Lake Champlain Basin Resilience to Extreme Events (BREE) (https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1556770).

However, unsatisfactory approaches to directly measuring the AMR burden carried by individuals has hampered efforts to assess interventions aimed at reducing selection for AMR. Metagenomics can provide accurate detection and quantification of AMR genes within an individual person's faecal flora (their gut ""resistome""). Using this approach, we aimed to test the hypothesis that differences in antimicrobial use across different hospitals in the United Kingdom will result in observable differences in the resistome of individual patients. Three National Health Service acute Hospital Trusts with markedly different antibiotic use and Clostridioides difficile infection rates collected faecal samples from anonymous patients which were discarded after C. difficile testing over a period of 9 to 15 months. Metagenomic DNA was extracted from these samples and sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. The resulting sequencing reads were analysed for taxonomic composition and for the presence of AMR genes. Among 683 faecal metagenomes we found huge variation between individuals in terms of taxonomic diversity (Shannon Index range 0.10-3.99) and carriage of AMR genes (Median 1.50 genes/cell/sample overall). We found no statistically significant differences in diversity (median Shannon index 2.16 (IQR 1.71-2.56), 2.15 (IQR 1.62-2.50) and 2.26 (IQR 1.55-2.51)) or carriage of AMR genes (median 1.37 genes/cell/sample (IQR 0.70-3.24), 1.70 (IQR 0.70-4.52) and 1.43 (IQR 0.55-3.71)) at the three trusts respectively. This was also the case across the sample collection period within the trusts. While we have not demonstrated differences over place or time using metagenomic sequencing of faecal discards, other sampling frameworks may be more suitable to determine whether organisational level differences in antibiotic use are associated with individual-level differences in burden of AMR carriage.",,"The research was supported by a grant from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Applied Research, RP-PG-0514-20015 and through the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance at University of Oxford (NIHR200915) in partnership with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), and the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre.

DESIGN: Ecological study design.
SETTING: Sardinia, Italy.
PARTICIPANTS: We used official reports on the total cases of COVID-19 in 2020, published data on NHL incidence, and socio-economic indicators by administrative unit, covering the whole regional population.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used multivariable regression analysis to explore the association between the natural logarithm (ln) of the 2020 cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and the ln-transformed NHL incidence in 1974-2003, weighing by population size and adjusting by socioeconomic deprivation and other covariates.
RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 increased in relation to past incidence of NHL (p < 0.001), socioeconomic deprivation (p = 0.006), and proportion of elderly residents (p < 0.001) and decreased with urban residency (p = 0.001). Several sensitivity analyses confirmed the finding of an association between COVID-19 and NHL.

This mapping of outcomes will be used to inform the development of a core outcome set (COS) for physiotherapy research in bronchiectasis. Outcomes reported in randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and RCT protocols were reviewed and evaluated. We included trials with physiotherapy as the main intervention, including pulmonary rehabilitation, exercise prescription, airway clearance, positive expiratory pressure devices, breathing training, self-management plans, and home exercise program. Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro) were searched from inception using a prespecified search strategy. Records including adult patients with bronchiectasis were included. Outcomes were listed verbatim and categorised into domains based on a pre-specified system, frequency of reporting and sources of variation were inspected.
RESULTS: Of 2158 abstracts screened, 37 trials (1202 participants) and 17 trial protocols were identified. Eighteen different physiotherapy techniques were investigated. A total of 331 outcomes were reported. No single outcome was reported by all trials. The most reported outcomes were lung function (27 trials, 50%), health related quality of life (26 trials, 48.1%), and dyspnoea (18 trials, 33.3%). A list of 104 unique outcomes covering 23 domains was created. Trials focus on physiological outcomes, mainly those related to respiratory system functions. Outcomes related to functioning and life impact are often neglected.
CONCLUSION: Outcome reporting in physiotherapy research for bronchiectasis was found to be inconsistent in terms of choosing and defining outcomes. Developing a core outcome set in this area of research is needed to facilitate aggregation of future trial results in systematic reviews that will in turn inform the strength of evidence for the effectiveness of physiotherapy. Outcome choice should include all stakeholders, including patients.

While the current clinical standard prognostic marker for PCa is the Gleason score, it is subject to inter-reviewer variability. This study compares two machine learning methods for discriminating between cancerous regions on digitized histology from 47 PCa patients. Whole-slide images were annotated by a GU fellowship-trained pathologist for each Gleason pattern. High-resolution tiles were extracted from annotated and unlabeled tissue. Patients were separated into a training set of 31 patients (Cohort A, n = 9345 tiles) and a testing cohort of 16 patients (Cohort B, n = 4375 tiles). Tiles from Cohort A were used to train a ResNet model, and glands from these tiles were segmented to calculate pathomic features to train a bagged ensemble model to discriminate tumors as (1) cancer and noncancer, (2) high- and low-grade cancer from noncancer, and (3) all Gleason patterns. The outputs of these models were compared to ground-truth pathologist annotations. The ensemble and ResNet models had overall accuracies of 89% and 88%, respectively, at predicting cancer from noncancer. The ResNet model was additionally able to differentiate Gleason patterns on data from Cohort B while the ensemble model was not. Our results suggest that quantitative pathomic features calculated from PCa histology can distinguish regions of cancer; however, texture features captured by deep learning frameworks better differentiate unique Gleason patterns.","We would like to thank our patients for their participation in this study, and the Medical College of Wisconsin Machine Learning Group for helpful feedback and discussion.","This research was funded by NIH/NCI R01CA218144, R21CA231892, R01CA249882, and the State of Wisconsin Tax Check Off Program for Prostate Cancer Research.",PLOS ONE,,Male; Humans; Deep Learning; Prostate; Prostatic Neoplasms; Machine Learning; Prognosis; Neoplasm Grading,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0278084,All OA; Gold,Article,"Duenweg, Savannah R.; Brehler, Michael; Bobholz, Samuel A.; Lowman, Allison K.; Winiarz, Aleksandra; Kyereme, Fitzgerald; Nencka, Andrew; Iczkowski, Kenneth A.; LaViolette, Peter S.","Duenweg, Savannah R.

On the other hand, a prevalence of more than 15% may pose to risk to mother and child, however, access to CS in a resource-limited country like Ethiopia was much lower than the aforementioned level, Therefore, this was the first study to determine the trend of CS, and factors that influence it.
METHODS: This was done based on the five Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys. Trend analysis was done separately for rural and urban. The significance of the trend was assessed using the Extended Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test. The factors on CS delivery were identified based on DHS 2016 data. A multi-level logistic regression analysis technique was used to identify the factors associated with cesarean section delivery. The analysis was adjusted for the different individual- and community-level factors affecting cesarean section delivery. Data analysis was conducted using STATA 14.1 software.
RESULT: The rate of cesarean section increased from 5.1% in 1995 to 16% in 2019 in an urban area and 0.001 in 1995 to 3% in a rural area, the overall increment of CS rate was 0.7% in 1995 to 2019 at 6%. The odds of cesarean section were higher among 25-34 years (AOR = 2.79; 95% CI: 1.92, 4.07) and 34-49 years (AOR = 5.23;95% CI: 2.85,9.59), among those educated at primary school level (AOR = 1.94; 95% CI: 1.23,3.11), secondary education (AOR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.17, 3.56) and higher education (AOR = 4.12; 95% CI: 2.33-7.29)with multiple pregnancies (AOR = 11.12; 95% CI: 5.37, 23.), with obesity (AOR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.45), living in an urban area (AOR = 2.28; /95% CI: 1.35-3.88), and increased with the number of ANC visit of 1-3 and 4th(AOR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.12, 4.58), (AOR = 3.34; 95% CI: 1.12, 4.58), respectively. The odds of cesarean section are lower among parity of 2-4 children (AOR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0 .37, 0.80) and greater than four birth order (AOR = 0.42;95% CI: 0.21,0.84).
CONCLUSION: In Ethiopia, the CS rate is below the WHO recommended level in both urban and rural areas, thus, intervention efforts need to be prioritized for women living in a rural area, empowering women's education, encouraging co-services such as ANC usage could all help to address the current problem.",We’d also want to express our gratitude to the MEASURE DHS Program and ICF International for allowing us to use the EDHS data.

However, limited understanding of infection dynamics in human LS exists due to species-specificity challenges. Reported here is a reproducible, easy-to-manipulate, and moderate-cost in vivo model to study human Plasmodium LS in mice; the ectopic huLiver model. Ectopic huLiver tumors were generated through subcutaneous injection of the HC-04 cell line and shown to be infectible by both freshly dissected sporozoites and through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Evidence for complete LS development was supported by the transition to blood-stage infection in mice engrafted with human erythrocytes. Additionally, this model was successfully evaluated for its utility in testing antimalarial therapeutics, as supported by primaquine acting as a causal prophylactic against P. falciparum. Presented here is a new platform for the study of human Plasmodium infection with the potential to aid in drug discovery.","Disclaimers: Material has been reviewed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.

Ephedrae herba (EH) and Coicis semen (CS) are two herbal medicines used to treat obesity in many herbal prescriptions, yet the effect and significance of this herbal pair have not been evaluated.
PURPOSE: This study is to elucidate the effect of a novel herbal pair, EH-CS, on obesity and identify the key synergistic mechanism underlying it.
METHODS: We investigated the network of herbs comprising the anti-obesity herbal prescriptions. Using the tools of network pharmacology, we investigated the compound-target interactions of EH and CS in combination to predict their effects in combination. Five EH-CS samples with different EH to CS ratios were prepared to investigate their efficacies in adipocytes.
RESULTS: 1-mode network analysis of herbs in prescriptions based on literature review revealed the importance of EH-CS in anti-obesity prescriptions. The herbal combination comprised of equivalent weights (1:1) of EH and CS most potently reduced mature adipocyte adiposity, although several markers of adipogenesis and lipid synthesis were more suppressed by pure EH. PTGS2 (COX-2 gene) expression, a common target of EH and CS as deduced by compound-target network analysis, was affected by EH-CS extract treatments. However, EH at high concentration (25 μg/ml) notably increased PTGS2 expression without adversely affecting cell viability. However, EH-CS combination of the same concentration markedly decreased PTGS2 gene expression.
CONCLUSION: These results show that the compounds in CS and EH act in concert to enhance the pharmacological effect of EH, but control unexpected effects of EH treatment.",,"LDW.

The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of VPS adjustable differential pressure valve on the head circumference (HC) and ventricular size (VS) stabilization in infants with post intraventricular haemorrhage, acquired and congenital hydrocephali.
METHODS: Forty-three hydrocephalic infants under 6 months old were prospectively included between 2014 and 2018. All patients were treated using a VPS with adjustable differential pressure valve. HC and transfontanelle ultrasonographic VS measurements were regularly performed and pressure valve modifications were done aiming HC and VS percentiles between the 25th and 75th. The patients were divided into two groups: infants with hydrocephalus due to an intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH-H), and infants with hydrocephalus due to other aetiologies (OAE-H).
RESULTS: The mean of pressure valve modification was 3.7 per patient in the IVH-H group, versus 2.95 in the OAE-H group. The median of last pressure valve value was higher at 8.5 cm H2O in the IVH-H group comparing to 5 cm H2O in the OAE-H group (p = 0.013).
CONCLUSION: Optimal VPS pressure valve values could be extremely difficult to settle in order to gain normalisation of the HC and VS in infants. However, after long term follow up (mean of 18 months) and several pressure valve modifications, this normalisation is possible and shows that infants with IVH-H need a higher pressure valve value comparing to infants with OAE-H.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Humans; Infant; Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt; Treatment Outcome; Hydrocephalus; Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunts; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Retrospective Studies,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0282571,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cattani, Adriano; Schwarzer, Franziska; Schwarzer, Mario; Spyrantis, Andrea; Marquardt, Gerhard; Schubert-Bast, Susanne; Seifert, Volker; Freiman, Thomas M.","Cattani, Adriano (Department of Neurosurgery, Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany); Schwarzer, Franziska (Department of Neurosurgery, Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany); Schwarzer, Mario (Department of Neuropaediatrics, Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany); Spyrantis, Andrea (Department of Neurosurgery, Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany); Marquardt, Gerhard (Department of Neurosurgery, Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany); Schubert-Bast, Susanne (Department of Neuropaediatrics, Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany); Seifert, Volker (Department of Neurosurgery, Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany); Freiman, Thomas M.

Mutations in OPA1 lead to autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA), an important cause of inherited blindness. The Guanosin Triphosphatase (GTPase) and GTPase effector domains (GEDs) of OPA1 are essential for mitochondrial fusion; yet, their specific roles remain elusive. Intriguingly, patients carrying OPA1 GTPase mutations have a higher risk of developing more severe multisystemic symptoms in addition to optic atrophy, suggesting pathogenic contributions for the GTPase and GED domains, respectively. We studied OPA1 GTPase and GED mutations to understand their domain-specific contribution to protein function by analyzing patient-derived cells and gain-of-function paradigms. Mitochondria from OPA1 GTPase (c.870+5G>A and c.889C>T) and GED (c.2713C>T and c.2818+5G>A) mutants display distinct aberrant cristae ultrastructure. While all OPA1 mutants inhibited mitochondrial fusion, some GTPase mutants resulted in elongated mitochondria, suggesting fission inhibition. We show that the GED is dispensable for fusion and OPA1 oligomer formation but necessary for GTPase activity. Finally, splicing defect mutants displayed a posttranslational haploinsufficiency-like phenotype but retained domain-specific dysfunctions. Thus, OPA1 domain-specific mutants result in distinct impairments in mitochondrial dynamics, providing insight into OPA1 function and its contribution to ADOA pathogenesis and severity.","We thank David Weaver, Alejandro Munizaga, and Ximena Vergés for their valuable technical support.

People who experience disasters often become more supportive of policies to address their underlying causes, and the pandemic may have similar spillover effects for public opinion. To test this idea, the study implements a survey experiment in Italy, Germany, and the United States in which half of the respondents were randomly assigned to a prime about the impact of the pandemic prior to answering questions about their support for public health policies. The results show that respondents who received the prime became more favorable toward increased government spending on domestic and foreign public health programs alike. These treatment effects were consistent across countries, across two different surveys in the United States conducted at different points in time, and across partisan subgroups. However, the treatment did not consistently increase support for more active and intrusive government policies to address specific public health challenges like smoking or HIV/AIDS. The results suggest that public health advocates may benefit from messaging that connects COVID-19 to the need for public health funding beyond the context of the pandemic.",,,Social Science & Medicine,,,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,2023-03,,,115840,All OA; Green,Article,"Singh, Renu","Singh, Renu (Bocconi University, Via Roberto Sarfatti, 25, 20100, Milano, MI, USA)",,"Singh, Renu ()",0,0,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10019036,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156250757,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health; 44 Human Society,3 Good Health and Well Being

Large-scale replication attempts for psychological results yielded shockingly low success rates and contributed to an increasing demand for open science practices among psychologists. However, preregistering one's studies is still not the norm in the field. Here, we conducted a study to explore possible reasons for this discrepancy.
METHODS: In a mixed-methods approach, we conducted an online survey assessing attitudes, motivations, and perceived obstacles with respect to preregistration. Respondents (N = 289) were psychological researchers that were recruited through their publications on Web of Science, PubMed, PSYNDEX, and PsycInfo, and preregistrations on OSF Registries. Based on the theory of planned behavior, we predicted that positive attitudes (moderated by the perceived importance of preregistration) as well as a favorable subjective norm and higher perceived behavioral control positively influence researchers' intention to preregister (directional hypothesis 1). Furthermore, we expected an influence of research experience on attitudes and perceived motivations and obstacles regarding preregistration (non-directional hypothesis 2). We analyzed these hypotheses with multiple regression models and included preregistration experience as a control variable.
RESULTS: Researchers' attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and the perceived importance of preregistration significantly predicted researchers' intention to use preregistration in the future (see hypothesis 1). Research experience influenced both researchers' attitudes and their perception of motivations to preregister, but not the perception of obstacles (see hypothesis 2). Descriptive reports on researchers' attitudes, motivations and obstacles regarding preregistration are provided.
DISCUSSION: Many researchers had already preregistered and had a rather positive attitude toward preregistration. Nevertheless, several obstacles were identified that may be addressed to improve and foster preregistration.","We are grateful to H. Bargon, A. Fritz, A. Kuznik, D. Maurer, and M.

Therefore, the hosts of kleptoplasts benefit from photosynthesis without constitutive photoendosymbiosis. Here, we report that the euglenozoan Rapaza viridis has only kleptoplasts derived from a specific strain of green alga, Tetraselmis sp., but no canonical plastids like those found in its sister group, the Euglenophyceae. R. viridis showed a dynamic change in the accumulation of cytosolic polysaccharides in response to light-dark cycles, and 13C isotopic labeling of ambient bicarbonate demonstrated that these polysaccharides originate in situ via photosynthesis; these data indicate that the kleptoplasts of R. viridis are functionally active. We also identified 276 sequences encoding putative plastid-targeting proteins and 35 sequences of presumed kleptoplast transporters in the transcriptome of R. viridis. These genes originated in a wide range of algae other than Tetraselmis sp., the source of the kleptoplasts, suggesting a long history of repeated horizontal gene transfer events from different algal prey cells. Many of the kleptoplast proteins, as well as the protein-targeting system, in R. viridis were shared with members of the Euglenophyceae, providing evidence that the early evolutionary stages in the green alga-derived secondary plastids of euglenophytes also involved kleptoplasty.","We thank Jun Kawahara, Taiki Koyama, and Tomomi Munekyo for their technical assistance; Dr. Masami Nakazawa (Osaka Prefecture University) for technical advice on experiments.

Since either inter- and intra- specific wide size range has been observed in the Mesotheriidae family in general, we wanted explore the ontogenic stage signature of the sample, by carrying out the first comprehensive paleohistological description of the appendicular system in Notoungulata. Results show that: 1) they can be classified as subadults and adults, based on the presence of bone tissues typical of ceased somatic growth; 2) there is a notorious inter-skeletal variation on bone growth rates (skeletal modularity), particularly, the humerus showed a slower diameter growth and less remodelling than the femur, resulting as a better element for ontogenetic analyses; 3) marked cyclical growth is observed, characterised by fast early ontogenic continuous growth, and subsequent fast/slow stratified bone tissue layering. In general, such growth pattern suggests that C. munozi had a similar ontogenetic growth process as other modern mammals, that it should also be influenced by other sex-related, ecological and environmental factors. Likely related to the presence of rapid climatic variations, due to orogenic uplift and concomitant re-organization of the drainage processes along the western tectonic front of the Central Andes at that time.","This research was part of the master’s thesis of JC-M (Campos-Medina, 2018), which was supervised by two of the authors KM, GM-S.

The astounding success even led to claims that the protein folding problem is ""solved"". However, protein folding problem is more than just structure prediction from sequence. Presently, it is unknown if the AlphaFold-triggered revolution could help to solve other problems related to protein folding. Here we assay the ability of AlphaFold to predict the impact of single mutations on protein stability (ΔΔG) and function. To study the question we extracted the pLDDT and  metrics from AlphaFold predictions before and after single mutation in a protein and correlated the predicted change with the experimentally known ΔΔG values. Additionally, we correlated the same AlphaFold pLDDT metrics with the impact of a single mutation on structure using a large scale dataset of single mutations in GFP with the experimentally assayed levels of fluorescence. We found a very weak or no correlation between AlphaFold output metrics and change of protein stability or fluorescence.

Accordingly, we conducted an analysis to understand the role of treatment-related stigma in depression care in Malawi by estimating the effect of patients' baseline anticipated treatment-related stigma on their 3-month probability of depression remission when newly identified with depression.
METHODS: We conducted depression screening and treatment at 10 noncommunicable disease (NCD) clinics across Malawi from April 2019 through December 2021. Eligible cohort participants were 18-65 years with depressive symptoms indicated by a PHQ-9 score ≥5. Questionnaires at the baseline and 3-month interviews included a vignette-based quantitative stigma instrument that measured treatment-related stigma, i.e., concerns about external stigma because of receiving depression treatment. Using inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounding and multiple imputation to account for missing data, this analysis relates participants' baseline levels of anticipated treatment stigma to the 3-month probability of achieving depression remission (i.e., PHQ-9 score < 5).
RESULTS: Of 743 included participants, 273 (37%) achieved depression remission by their 3-month interview. The probability of achieving depression remission at the 3-month interview among participants with high anticipated treatment stigma (0.31; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.23, 0.39)) was 10 percentage points lower than among the low/neutral stigma group (risk: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.45; RD: -0.10; 95% CI: -0.19, -0.003).
CONCLUSION: In Malawi, a reduction in anticipated depression treatment-related stigma among NCD patients initiating depression treatment could improve depression outcomes. Further investigation is necessary to understand the modes by which stigma can be successfully reduced to improve mental health outcomes and quality of life among people living with depression.",,"This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, awarded to BWP (U19MH113202-01; https://www.nimh.nih.gov/).

500,pub.1156262042,10.1016/j.schres.2023.03.015,36933976,,Seasonality of presentation and birth in catatonia,"BACKGROUND: Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with both psychiatric disorders and medical conditions. Understanding of the pathophysiology of catatonia remains limited, and the role of the environment is unclear. Although seasonal variations have been shown for many of the disorders underlying catatonia, the seasonality of this syndrome has not yet been adequately explored.
METHODS: Clinical records were screened to identify a cohort of patients suffering from catatonia and a control group of psychiatric inpatients, from 2007 to 2016 in South London. In a cohort study, the seasonality of presentation was explored fitting regression models with harmonic terms, while the effect of season of birth on subsequent development of catatonia was analyzed using regression models for count data. In a case-control study, the association between month of birth and catatonia was studied fitting logistic regression models.
RESULTS: In total, 955 patients suffering from catatonia and 23,409 controls were included. The number of catatonic episodes increased during winter, with a peak in February. Similarly, an increasing number of cases was observed during summer, with a second peak in August. However, no evidence for an association between month of birth and catatonia was found.
CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of catatonia showed seasonal variation in accordance with patterns described for many of the disorders underlying catatonia, such as mood disorders and infections. We found no evidence for an association between season of birth and risk of developing catatonia. This may imply that recent triggers may underpin catatonia, rather than distal events.","Declaration of competing interest MSZ declares honoraria for a lecture from Eisai Co., Ltd.

This does not fit with current theory, based on random graphs, according to which strong connectivity depends on mean degree and degree-degree correlations. And it has important implications for other properties of real networks and the dynamical behavior of many complex systems. We find that strong connectivity depends crucially on the extent to which the network has an overall direction or hierarchical ordering-a property measured by trophic coherence. Using percolation theory, we find the critical point separating weakly and strongly connected regimes and confirm our results on many real-world networks, including ecological, neural, trade, and social networks. We show that the connectivity structure can be disrupted with minimal effort by a targeted attack on edges which run counter to the overall direction. This means that many dynamical processes on networks can depend significantly on a small fraction of edges.",The authors would like to thank the Centre for Doctoral Training in Topological Design and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for funding this research.

Previous work used Unconditioned Stimulus (US) to support a theoretical division between two different types of valence representations for a stimulus: the semantic representation of valence, i.e., stored accumulated knowledge about the value of the stimulus, and the affective representation of valence, i.e., the valence of the affective response to this stimulus. The current work extended past research by using a neutral Conditioned Stimulus (CS) in the context of reversal learning, a type of associative learning. The impact of expected uncertainty (the variability of rewards) and unexpected uncertainty (reversal) on the evolving temporal dynamics of the two types of valence representations of the CS was tested in two experiments. Results show that in an environment presenting the two types of uncertainty, the adaptation process (learning rate) of the choices and of the semantic valence representation is slower than the adaptation of the affective valence representation. In contrast, in environments with only unexpected uncertainty (i.e., fixed rewards), there is no difference in the temporal dynamics of the two types of valence representations. Implications for models of affect, value-based learning theories, and value-based decision-making models are discussed.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest concerning the publication or the authorship of this article.

METHODS: During the first pandemic wave, 140 consenting and eligible hospitalized adult participants with mild-moderate symptomatic disease (specific standard RT-PCR assay positive) were selected as per a convenience sample, and randomized (1:1 ratio) to an open-label (assessor blind) two-arm multicentric drug trial; standard of care (SOC as per Indian guidelines) versus AYUSH 64 combined with SOC (AYUSH plus). Participants were assessed daily and discharged once clinical recovery (CR, primary efficacy) was achieved which was based on a predetermined set of criteria (resolution of symptoms, normal peripheral oximetry, and negative specific RT-PCR assay). Each participant was followed using an indigenous software program(mobile phone) and completed a 12-week study period. The dose of AYUSH 64 was 2 tablets oral, 500 mg each, bid for 12 weeks (AYUSH plus only). Significant P was <0.05 (two-sided). On randomization, the groups were found well matched.
RESULTS: The mean interval time from randomization to CR was significantly superior in the AYUSH plus group [mean 6.45 days versus 8.26 days, 95% Confidence Interval of the difference -3.02 to -0.59 (P = 0.003, Student's 't test] as per-protocol analysis (134 participants); significant (P = 0.002) on an intention to treat analysis. 70% of the participants in AYUSH plus recovered during the first week (P = 0.046, Chi-square) and showed a significantly better change in physical health, fatigue, and quality of life measures. 48 adverse events, mostly mild and gut related, were reported by each group. There were 20 patient withdrawals (8 in AYUSH plus) but none due to an AE. There were no deaths. Daily assessment (hospitalization) and supervised drug intake ensured robust efficacy data. The open-label design was a concern (study outcome).
CONCLUSIONS: AYUSH 64 in combination with SOC hastened recovery, reduced hospitalization, and improved health in COVID-19. It was considered safe and well-tolerated. Further clinical validation (Phase III) is required.

Through this mechanism, CN disseminate throughout the body, sometimes resulting in a potentially fatal condition-Cryptococcal Meningitis (CM). Justifiably, vomocytosis studies have focused primarily on MΦ, as alveolar MΦ within the lung act as first responders that ultimately expel this fungal pathogen. Herein, we hypothesize that dendritic cells (DCs), an innate immune cell with attributes that include phagocytosis and antigen presentation, can also act as 'vomocytes'. Presciently, this report shows that vomocytosis of CN indeed occurs from murine, bone marrow-derived DCs. Primarily through time-lapse microscopy imaging, we show that rates of vomocytosis events from DCs are comparable to those seen from MΦ and further, are independent of the presence of the CN capsule and infection ratios. Moreover, the phagosome-altering drug bafilomycin A inhibits this phenomenon from DCs. Although DC immunophenotype does not affect the total number of vomocytic events, we observed differences in the numbers of CN per phagosome and expulsion times. Interestingly, these observations were similar in murine, bone marrow-derived MΦ. This work not only demonstrates the vomocytic ability of DCs, but also investigates the complexity of vomocytosis regulation in this cell type and MΦ under multiple modulatory conditions. Understanding the vomocytic behavior of different phagocytes and their phenotypic subtypes is needed to help elucidate the full picture of the dynamic interplay between CN and the immune system. Critically, deeper insight into vomocytosis could reveal novel approaches to treat CM, as well as other immune-related conditions.","We thank the Gelli Lab at UC Davis for providing the CN strains used in this study.

We developed the retrospective Clinical Interview Schedule Revised (rCIS-R) to assess depression relapse in the previous 12 weeks, for use in a clinical trial of maintenance antidepressant treatment. We assessed test-retest reliability and construct validity in relation to a Global Rating Question (GRQ) about worsening mood, participants stopping their study medication and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores.
METHODS: In our study 444 participants provided data for rCIS-R, GRQ and PHQ-9 and 396 participants completed rCIS-R on two occasions about 30 minutes apart. The reliability study was nested within a randomised controlled trial (ANTLER).
RESULTS: We found substantial test-retest agreement for the rCIS-R definition of relapse (kappa 0.84 (95%CI 0.71 to 0.97)), for individual sections and timing of relapse (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient 0.94 (95%CI 0.92 to 0.95)). Comparison of relapse with GRQ, stopping study medication and PHQ-9 supported the construct validity of the rCIS-R.
CONCLUSIONS: The rCIS-R provides a reliable way of assessing relapse of depression over the previous 12 weeks. Its brevity, self-report format, simplicity of scoring and absence of training requirement makes it attractive to use in randomised controlled trials.","We are grateful to all the patients that took part in the ANTLER trial.

The accuracy of the actor-partner interdependence models (APIM) which offer in-depth insights into the dyadic relationships between female and male partners were estimated. The results of the chi-square test enabled us to reject the hypothesis of actor indistinguishability, therefore the model proposing distinguishability with respect to gender was explored further. The results suggest that women's credit management behavior patterns predict changes in her assessment of well-being. Moreover, the financial behavior patterns of women have an impact on the assessment of well-being as reported by their male partners.

Together with other unpredictable events occurring in the world today, this increase poses a challenge: the necessity to accelerate a switch from face-to-face data collection to different modes, that have usually been considered to result in lower response rates. However, recent research has established that the simple response rate is a feeble measure of study quality. Therefore, this article aims to analyze the effect of survey characteristics, especially the survey mode, on the nonresponse bias. The bias measure used is the internal criteria first proposed by Sodeur and first applied by Kohler. The analysis is based on the survey documentation and results from the International Social Survey Programme waves 1996-2018 and the European Social Survey rounds 1 to 9. Random-effects three-level meta-regression models, based on data from countries from each inhabited continent, were created in order to estimate the impact of the survey mode or modes, sampling design, fieldwork experience, year of data collection, and response rate on the nonresponse bias indicator. Several ways of nesting observations within clusters were also proposed. The results suggest that using mail and some types of mixed-mode surveys were connected to lower nonresponse bias than using face-to-face mode surveys.",I would like to thank Piotr Jabkowski and Kamila Szymkowiak for their help in this research.,"The author gratefully acknowledges funding from the National Science Centre, Poland (AR: PRELUDIUM-17 grant no. 2019/33/N/HS6/00322 https://ncn.gov.pl/en).

While evidence is emerging to describe how engagement was affected across various settings, insights about how some organizations at the policy and practice level of healthcare were able to sustain or adapt patient engagement activities is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: This paper addresses the following research question: ""How were healthcare, government, and patient partner organizations able to sustain or adapt patient engagement activities during the COVID-19 pandemic?""
METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted to understand how patient engagement activities were maintained or adapted in a variety of healthcare, government, and patient partner organizations in Canada throughout the pandemic. This analysis was part of a larger qualitative, multiple case study where one-to-one interviews were conducted with organizational leaders, managers and patient partners.
RESULTS: The following themes were identified as key aspects of maintaining or adapting patient engagement activities: 1) having an embedded organizational culture of patient engagement; 2) adapting patient engagement activities to focus on COVID-19 response efforts; 3) having patient partners who exercised leadership and advocacy to support patient care and experiences during the pandemic; and 4) leveraging virtual technology as a communication tool to engage patient partners.
CONCLUSION: This paper highlights important insights that may be useful to other health care organizations on how to sustain or adapt patient engagement activities during a healthcare crisis. Having patient engagement embedded within an organization's culture supported by, but not limited to, infrastructure, resources, investments in dedicated staff and patient partner leadership, and communication strategies and tools enabled continued patient engagement activities during the pandemic.","The authors would like to thank Aditi Desai for her support on this project.

The inhibition of α-amylase lowers blood glucose levels and helps to alleviate hyperglycemia complications. Herein, we systematically screened the potential HPA inhibitors from a library of natural products by molecular modeling. The modeling encompasses molecular docking, MM/GBSA binding energy calculations, MD simulations, and ADMET analysis. This research identified newboulaside B, newboulaside A, quercetin-3-O-β-glucoside, and sasastilboside A as the top four potential HPA inhibitors from the library of natural products, whose Glide docking scores and MM/GBSA binding energies range from -9.191 to -11.366 kcal/mol and -19.38 to -77.95 kcal/mol, respectively. Based on the simulation, among them, newboulaside B was found as the best HPA inhibitor. Throughout the simulation, with the deviation of 3Å (acarbose = 3Å), it interacted with ASP356, ASP300, ASP197, THR163, ARG161, ASP147, ALA106, and GLN63 via hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the comprehensive ADMET analysis revealed that it has good pharmacokinetic properties having not acutely toxic, moderately bioavailable, and non-inhibitor nature toward cytochrome P450. All the results suggest that newboulaside B might be a promising candidate for drug discovery against type 2 diabetes.","The author acknowledges Schrödinger Inc. for the software license support for the thesis research work.

A large body of clinical evidence suggests that disruptions in SOD may be key to social communication deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In particular, egocentric biases have been found in cognitive, affective, behavioural, and motor domains. However, research in this area is scarce and consists of recognition paradigms that have used only static images; these methods may be insufficient for assessing SOD, given the increasing role of embodiment in our understanding of the pathophysiology of ASD.
METHOD: A single-centre, prospective pilot study was carried out to investigate, for the first time, self-recognition and SOD in seven adolescents with ASD compared with matched, typically developing controls (TDCs) using the ""Alter Ego""TM double mirror paradigm. The participants viewed a double mirror in which their own face was gradually morphed into the face of an unfamiliar other (self-to-other sequence) or vice versa (other-to-self sequence); participants were instructed to indicate at which point the morph looked more like their own face than the other's face. Two judgement criteria were used: 1) M1: the threshold at which subjects started to recognize their own face during the other-to-self morphing sequence; 2) M2: the threshold at which subjects started to recognize the other's face during the self-to-other morphing sequence.
RESULTS: Consistent with the predictions, the results showed that the participants with ASD exhibited earlier self-recognition in the other-to-self sequence and delayed other-recognition in the self-to-other sequence, suggesting an egocentric bias. SOD impairments were also marginally correlated with ASD severity, indicating earlier face recognition in more severely affected individuals. Furthermore, in contrast with that of TDCs, the critical threshold for switching between self and other varied with the direction of morphing in ASD participants. Finally, these differences in face recognition and SOD using mirrors, unlike previous research using static images, support the central place of bodily self-consciousness in SOD impairments.
CONCLUSIONS: Although additional research is needed to replicate the results of this preliminary study, it revealed the first behavioural evidence of altered SOD in ASD individuals on an embodied, semiecological face-recognition paradigm. Implications for understanding ASD are discussed from a developmental perspective, and new research and therapeutic perspectives are presented.",The authors thank Pierre Ailliot and Cyril Dusausoy for the statistical analysis used in the study.,the authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,"Humans; Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Prospective Studies; Pilot Projects; Recognition, Psychology; Facial Recognition",2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0275018,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lavenne-Collot, Nathalie; Tersiguel, Marie; Dissaux, Nolwenn; Degrez, Céline; Bronsard, Guillaume; Botbol, Michel; Berthoz, Alain","Lavenne-Collot, Nathalie (Service de Psychiatrie de L’Enfant et de l ‘Adolescent, CHRU Brest, Brest, France; Université de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France; Laboratoire du traitement de l’information médicale, Inserm U1101, Brest, France); Tersiguel, Marie (Service de Psychiatrie de L’Enfant et de l ‘Adolescent, CHRU Brest, Brest, France; Université de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France); Dissaux, Nolwenn (Service de Psychiatrie de L’Enfant et de l ‘Adolescent, CHRU Brest, Brest, France; Université de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France); Degrez, Céline (Service de Psychiatrie de L’Enfant et de l ‘Adolescent, CHRU Brest, Brest, France); Bronsard, Guillaume (Service de Psychiatrie de L’Enfant et de l ‘Adolescent, CHRU Brest, Brest, France; Université de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France; Département de Sciences Humaines et Sociales, EA 7479, EA 3279 (CEReSS, AMU), Brest, France); Botbol, Michel (Université de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France; Professeur Emérite de Psychiatrie de l’Enfant et de l’Adolescent, Université de Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France); Berthoz, Alain (Professeur Honoraire au Collège de France, Paris, France; Centre Interdisciplinaire de Biologie (CIRB), Paris, France)","Lavenne-Collot, Nathalie (Centre Hospitalier Régional Universitaire de Brest; University of Western Brittany; Laboratory of Medical Information Processing)","Lavenne-Collot, Nathalie (Centre Hospitalier Régional Universitaire de Brest; University of Western Brittany; Laboratory of Medical Information Processing); Tersiguel, Marie (Centre Hospitalier Régional Universitaire de Brest; University of Western Brittany); Dissaux, Nolwenn (Centre Hospitalier Régional Universitaire de Brest; University of Western Brittany); Degrez, Céline (Centre Hospitalier Régional Universitaire de Brest); Bronsard, Guillaume (Centre Hospitalier Régional Universitaire de Brest; University of Western Brittany); Botbol, Michel (University of Western Brittany; University of Western Brittany); Berthoz, Alain (Collège de France; Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0275018&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156250967,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,

Standard of care antidepressants are the cornerstone of MDD treatment; however, nonadherence to antidepressants has been widely recognized as one of the reasons for treatment failure in MDD. Delayed response in current therapies can take up to 4 or even 8 weeks for patients to experience therapeutic benefits. Low treatment response rates are seen in a considerable amount of patients, with early-stage treatment-resistant depression (TRD) affecting 50% of patients receiving first-line treatments and 30% developing into substantive TRD. Given these treatment gaps, there is an urgent need to develop novel antidepressants with a faster onset of action and shorter treatment course, which could improve adherence and treatment response rates. The neurobiology of depression is multifactorial, with different pathways converging on the development of the neurocircuit dysfunction characteristic of depression. Neuroactive steroids play an important role in modulating acute and chronic stress via their phasic and tonic inhibitory effects on select GABAA receptors, ultimately modulating neurocircuit function. With clinical recognition of the importance of neurosteroids in the modulation of GABAA signaling pathways, researchers have developed novel neuroactive steroid-based pharmacotherapies that have been tested in clinical studies. Given their rapid onset of action and shorter treatment course, these novel antidepressants have the potential to change the treatment paradigm for MDD and PPD.",,,The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry,,"Female; Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; Neurosteroids; Antidepressive Agents; Suicide; Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,84,Suppl 1,,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Deligiannidis, Kristina M; Clayton, Anita H","Deligiannidis, Kristina M (Northwell Health, Glen Oaks, New York.); Clayton, Anita H (University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia.)",,"Deligiannidis, Kristina M (Northwell Health); Clayton, Anita H (University of Virginia)",0,0,,,https://www.psychiatrist.com/read-pdf/46140,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156242447,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Going forward, will their pandemic resume gaps be stigmatized or forgiven? In a recent survey experiment in the United States, I find that US adults have negative perceptions of individuals who were unemployed during the novel coronavirus pandemic. When asked to select among fictional applicants for a job opening in the hospitality industry, respondents prefer those who were employed continuously throughout the pandemic. Respondents are about 20% less likely to choose applicants with pandemic resume gaps, regardless of whether they were laid off, stopped working to supervise virtual school, or yo-yoed in and out of employment. Respondents also describe applicants with pandemic resume gaps in more negative terms, perceiving them as less hardworking, less dedicated, less professional, and less qualified than otherwise identical applicants who remained employed. Public opinion toward individuals with breaks in employment during the pandemic matters because it may affect public policy, and because stigma harms job seekers in multiple ways. Furthermore, the results of the experiment are consistent among survey respondents with hiring and managerial experience. While we should always be cautious about generalizing from survey experiments, these findings suggest that people who were out of work during the COVID-19 pandemic may face disadvantages when they return to the labor market.","I am grateful for logistical assistance from the Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa, support from the Women, Gender, and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association, and feedback from Patrick Leblond and Kate Weisshaar.","This study was funded by a small grant from (no grant number) from the Women, Gender, and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association, https://connect.apsanet.org/s16/.

METHODS: We performed paranasal sinus computed tomography in 19,961 adult patients between 2003 and 2022. The race of the patients was East Asian (n = 71), Caucasian (n = 71), or Middle Eastern (n = 71). The expected lengths of the NSF and anterior skull base defect were measured and analyzed according to race, age, and sex.
RESULTS: Compared with Caucasians and Middle Easterners, East Asians had a shorter NSF length (p < 0.001) and lower ratio of the expected NSF length to the expected defect length (p < 0.001). There was no difference in the values among age groups. The expected NSF length was longer, and the ratio of the expected NSF length to the expected defect length was higher, in males than females (p < 0.001 for both).
CONCLUSIONS: East Asians and females had a shorter NSF length and lower ratio of expected NSF to surgical defect lengths after anterior skull base reconstruction compared with the other races and with males, respectively.

However, previously used tasks have been controlled, and it is unclear whether clinical measurements of the ankle DF-ROM, are associated with landing positions during sport-specific task. This study sought to determine the relationship between ankle DF-ROM and landing positions.
METHODS: Thirty male soccer players participated in this study. The ankle DF-ROM was measured by the weight bearing lunge test in degrees using a cell phone app (TiltMeter). Landing patterns were assessed during a soccer-specific task using landing error scoring system items using Kinovea software. Simple correlations were used to evaluate the relationships between ankle DF-ROM and landing error scores.
RESULTS: Significant correlations were found between ankle DF-ROM and landing errors (r = -0.450, P = 0.006). A decreased ankle DF-ROM was associated with greater landing errors in a soccer specific situation.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ankle DF-ROM may serve a useful clinical measure for identifying poor landing posture in the real-world environment. Therefore, assessment of ankle DF-ROM could be included in the screening process, which could help identify the cause of the faulty motion.","We would like to thank the coaches and soccer players, as well as all those who helped in this research.",The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,"Male; Humans; Ankle; Ankle Joint; Soccer; Posture; Range of Motion, Articular; Biomechanical Phenomena",2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0283150,All OA; Gold,Article,"Akbari, Hadi; Shimokochi, Yohei; Sheikhi, Bahram","Akbari, Hadi (Department of Sport Sciences, University of Zabol, Zabol, Iran); Shimokochi, Yohei (Department of Health and Sport Management, School of Health and Sport Sciences, Osaka University of Health and Sport Sciences, Osaka, Japan); Sheikhi, Bahram (Department of Biomechanics and Sport Injuries, Kharazmi University, Tehran, Iran)","Akbari, Hadi (Zabol University)","Akbari, Hadi (Zabol University); Shimokochi, Yohei (Osaka University of Health and Sport Sciences); Sheikhi, Bahram (Kharazmi University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283150&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156251022,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4207 Sports Science and Exercise,

A retrospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that grow in or on the uterus of women. Globally, they occur in more than 80% of women of African ancestry and 70% in white women. Uterine fibroid requires much attention because of its high incidence rate among women of all races and ages. This study sought to document the age of first diagnosis and incidence rates of uterine fibroids in our urban setting.
METHODS: This study reviewed and analyzed the ages and year of diagnosis of all 2,469 patients with the first diagnosis of uterine fibroids from 1st January 2018 to 31st December 2021 in South-Central Ghana. The obtained data were analyzed using GNU PSPP, Python on Jupyter Notebook and Libre Office Calc with statistical significance level set at p≤0.05.
RESULTS: The overall average age was 36.29±8.08 years, with age range 17-61 years and the age groups with the highest frequencies were 35-39 years (n = 642, 26.00%), 30-34 years (n = 563, 22.80%) and 40-44 years (n = 381, 15.43%). The mean ages of the patients in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 were 36.70±8.00 years (95%CI = 35.97-37.43), 37.07±7.66 years (95%CI = 36.45-37.70), 35.92±7.87 years (95%CI = 35.30-36.53) and 35.78±8.54 years (95%CI = 35.19-36.38) respectively. The incidence rate (per 100,000) of uterine fibroids in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 were 66.77 (95% CI = 60.63-72.90), 81.86 (95%CI = 75.19-88.58), 85.60 (95%CI = 78.85-92.35) and 92.40 (95%CI = 85.88-98.92) respectively, with 35-39 age group recording the highest in all years.

Taking a typical industrial town in China as an example, the study explored the operating characteristics of rural factor flow networks and the relations of multi-factor flows based on the social survey method and fine-grained flows data. Results showed that population flows, capital flows and policy flows increased significantly in rural areas. Thereinto, population flows, especially labor flows, mainly ran into the townships and industrial cluster villages, so did capital inflows and outflows, while policy flows ran around the township. The villages with dense population and capital flows formed the ""central villages"", which had exceeded the township in the two flow networks. Policy flows and capital flows played a guiding role in population flows, so did the policy flows on the capital flows. Meanwhile, the population flows and the capital flows could reinforce each other. In conclusion, a multi-center structure network with the separation of economic center and administrative center had been formed in rural areas. And there was a close interaction between these factor flows.

Public health restrictions associated with the pandemic caused widespread psychological distress including depression and anxiety, increased fear, panic, and stress. These trends are particularly concerning for families raising neuroatypical children such as those with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), as these children are already more likely than their typically developing peers to experience comorbid mental health issues, and to experience greater distress when required to stay indoors. Families with children who have ADHD are also at greater risk for experiencing heightened familial stress due to the challenges associated with managing ADHD behavioural symptoms, greater parental discord and divorce, and greater financial difficulties compared to other families. The current study engaged families comprised of at least one child diagnosed with ADHD to elucidate 1) the unique ways that the COVID-19 pandemic affected their mental health and 2) the specific barriers these families faced to maintaining optimal mental wellbeing.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 33 participants (15 parent-child dyads) engaged in virtual interviews. Content analysis revealed that the most frequently identified mental health effects for families were increased child anxiety and disconnectedness, as well as deteriorating parental mental health. The most frequently identified barriers to maintaining optimal mental wellbeing were lack of routine, lack of social interaction and social supports, and uncertainty and fear.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore areas of need during times of large-scale social isolation, specifically for families with children who have ADHD. This work contributes to a growing body of research aimed at creating safeguards to support mental wellbeing for vulnerable families during times of crisis.",The authors would like to thank all families who participated in this study.

Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive imaging tool that allows monitoring in real time the topographical changes in aeration and ventilation.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pattern of distribution of pulmonary ventilation through EIT before and after anesthesia induction in pediatric patients without lung disease undergoing nonthoracic surgery.
METHODS: This was a prospective observational study including healthy children younger than 5 years who underwent nonthoracic surgery. Monitoring was performed continuously before and throughout the surgical period. Data analysis was divided into 5 periods: induction (spontaneous breathing, SB), ventilation-5min, ventilation-30min, ventilation-late and recovery-SB. In addition to demographic data, mechanical ventilation parameters were also collected. Ventilation impedance (Delta Z) and pulmonary ventilation distribution were analyzed cycle by cycle at the 5 periods.
RESULTS: Twenty patients were included, and redistribution of ventilation from the posterior to the anterior region was observed with the beginning of mechanical ventilation: on average, the percentage ventilation distribution in the dorsal region decreased from 54%(IC95%:49-60%) to 49%(IC95%:44-54%). With the restoration of spontaneous breathing, ventilation in the posterior region was restored.
CONCLUSION: There were significant pulmonary changes observed during anesthesia and controlled mechanical ventilation in children younger than 5 years, mirroring the findings previously described adults. Monitoring these changes may contribute to guiding the individualized settings of the mechanical ventilator with the goal to prevent postoperative complications.","We thank the statistics team, especially for the help of Sandra Regina Malagutti and the entire team at the surgical center.",The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,"Adult; Humans; Child; Respiration, Artificial; Electric Impedance; Tomography; Pulmonary Ventilation; Lung; Anesthesia, General",2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0283039,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nascimento, Milena S.; Rebello, Celso M.; Costa, Eduardo L.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of burnout and the contributing variables, and to explore how, from health workforce management perspective, HPs' experiences related to carrying out COVID-19 duties would be associated with their burnout.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, open online survey, informed by physical and psychological attributes reportedly related to burnout, the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), was completed by HPs in Macau, China during October and December 2021. Factors associated with burnout were analysed using multiple logistic regressions.
RESULTS: Among the 498 valid responses, the participants included doctors (37.5%), nurses (27.1%), medical laboratory technologist (11.4%) and pharmacy professionals (10.8%), with the majority being female (66.1%), aged between 25-44years (66.0%), and participated in the COVID-19 duties (82.9%). High levels of burnout (personal (60.4%), work-related (50.6%) and client-related (31.5%)), anxiety (60.6%), and depression (63.4%) were identified. Anxiety and depression remained significantly and positively associated with all types of burnout after controlling for the strong effects of demographic and work factors (e.g. working in the public sector or hospital, or having COVID-19 duties). HPs participated in COVID-19 duties were more vulnerable to burnout than their counterparts and were mostly dissatisfied with the accessibility of psychological support at workplace (62.6%), workforce distribution for COVID-19 duties (50.0%), ability to rest and recover (46.2%), and remuneration (44.7%), all of which were associated with the occurrence of burnout.
CONCLUSIONS: Personal, professional and health management factors were found attributable to the burnout experienced by HPs during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring actions from individual and organizational level.

Genetic variations were established among the 38 different subtypes detected so far, 14 of which are commonly found in human and animal hosts. The aim of the present study is to estimate the prevalence of the common Blastocystis subtypes and evaluate the possible correlation with several variables (gender, age, symptoms, domestic animals…), among patients from the southern region of Syria. Fecal samples were collected from individuals suffering from gastrointestinal complaints. Microscopic examination along with genotype analyses using seven pairs of subtype-specific primers was performed. Our results revealed the presence of Blastocystis sp. in 46 isolates out of the 60 samples microscopically studied (76.7%); single infection was detected in 24 isolates whereas co-infection with other protozoa was identified in 22 ones. Molecular detection targeting the SSU rRNA gene revealed a 100% positive presence of Blastocystis sp. in all the samples. Genotyping results detected the presence of five different subtypes (ST1-ST5) with varying proportions. However, ST1 was the dominant subtype observed (66.7%). Mixed subtype infections were found in 9 isolates (15%). Three samples remained undefined, nonetheless. Our statistical results showed no significant correlation between Blastocystis STs infection and the different studied variables. In conclusion, this study provides the first genetic characterization of Blastocystis subtypes prevalence in patients from the southern region of Syria. ST1 distribution was highly predominant. Further molecular studies are needed to estimate the prevalence of Blastocystis sp. infection in other regions in Syria and to understand the epidemiology and sources of transmission to humans.",The authors gratefully acknowledge all the patients and their families for taking part in this study.

The proposed control procedure undertakes to improve the controller's adaptability, allowing it to flexibly manipulate the control stiffness which aids in efficiently rejecting the bounded exogenous disturbances while preserving the system's closed-loop stability and economizing the overall control energy expenditure. The proposed scheme is realized by augmenting the ubiquitous LQI controller with an innovative online weight adaptation law that adaptively modulates the state-weighting factors of the internal performance index. The weight adaptation law is formulated as a pre-calibrated function of dissipative terms, anti-dissipative terms, and model-reference tracking terms to achieve the desired flexibility in the controller design. The adjusted state weighting factors are used by the Riccati equation to yield the time-varying state-compensator gains.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,"Adaptation, Physiological; Acclimatization",2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0283079,All OA; Gold,Article,"Saleem, Omer; Iqbal, Jamshed; Afzal, Muhammad Shahzad","Saleem, Omer (Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan); Iqbal, Jamshed (School of Computer Science, Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom); Afzal, Muhammad Shahzad (Department of Electrical and Software Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada)","Iqbal, Jamshed (University of Hull)","Saleem, Omer (National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences); Iqbal, Jamshed (University of Hull); Afzal, Muhammad Shahzad (University of Calgary)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283079&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156250992,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics",

A ban is supported by several Member States but rejected by most farmers. What are citizens' preferences to phase out glyphosate? To assess whether taxation could be an alternative to a ban, we conducted a discrete choice experiment in five European countries. Our results reveal that the general public is strongly willing to pay for a reduction in glyphosate use. However, while 75.5% of respondents stated to support a ban in the pre-experimental survey, experimental results reveal that in 73.35% of cases, earmarked taxation schemes are preferred when they lead to a strong reduction in glyphosate use for an increase in food price lower than that induced by a ban.

Yet, high-risk fertility behaviours are pivotal to improve maternal and child health. This study aims to assess geographical variations of, and to identify risk factors associated with high-risk fertility behaviours among married women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo using the 2013-14 Demographic and Health Survey.
METHODS: Overall, 11,497 married women were selected from a nationally representative using a two-stage sampling design. Standard logistic regressions were performed to identify individual- and household/community-level factors associated with high-risk fertility behaviours. Additionally, interactions between women's age and education, and urban residence were tested. Bernoulli based spatial scan statistics were used to identify the presence of high-risk fertility behaviours spatial clusters using Kulldorff's SaTScan version 9.6 software. ArcGIS 10.7 was used to visualize the spatial variations of high-risk fertility behaviours. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis was employed using Multiscale GWR version 2.0 software.
RESULTS: Findings indicated that more than two-third of married women exhibited high-risk fertility behaviours in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Multivariate logistic regression showed that education was negatively and significantly associated with the odds of high-risk fertility behaviours. In contrast, women's age significantly increased the odds of high-risk fertility behaviours. Interactions between urban residence and women's education and age confirmed the urban advantage identified from previous studies. Finally, high-risk fertility behaviours were highly clustered in the Northeastern provinces of the country.
CONCLUSION: The study showed that there were significant geographical variations of high-risk fertility behaviours across provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The paper also identified significant-high hot spots of high-risk fertility behaviours in the Northeastern provinces of the country. To reduce high-risk fertility behaviours, and ultimately improve maternal and child outcomes in the country, policymakers and health planners need to strategically address these inequalities. Finally, this paper highlighted the persistent needs of country-specific studies due to differences across sub-Saharan African countries in terms of social development and cultures.","The authors wish to express their gratitude to the DHS Program, USA, for its generosity in providing them full access to the data.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SUBJECTS: Ten eyes of 10 patients (4 men and 6 women, mean age 80.4 years) diagnosed with unilateral Type 3 MNV who developed type 3 MNV in the fellow normal eye during the follow-up period were studied.
METHODS: The time of onset of type 3 MNV was defined as the time when retinal exudation was detected by OCT. The blood flow of a 3 x 3 mm or 6 x 6 mm area in the deep capillary plexus (DCP) and the outer retina (OR) including the central fovea were assessed at the onset and at 6 months prior to the onset of the type 3 MNV.
RESULTS: All MNVs that developed in the fellow eye were type 3 MNVs. Abnormal blood flow signals in the MNVs were detected in the DCP and/or the OR by OCTA at the onset in all cases. Eight of the 10 eyes had OCTA recordings prior to the development of the MNV: 3 eyes had non-exudative MNVs only in the DCP and 5 eyes had non-exudative MNVs in the DCP and OR. The exudation appeared on the average 3.5 months after the non-exudative MNV was observed in the fellow eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: A non-exudative MNV in the fellow eyes can already be observed by OCTA in eyes before the onset of the exudation. Knowing this will help clinicians not only how to treat these eyes appropriately but will also help in determining the origin of the MNV.","The authors thank Professor Emeritus Duco Hamasaki of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami, for his critical discussion and editing of the manuscript.","Dr. Yamaguchi has nothing to disclose.

The relationship between dysmenorrhea severity and QOL has been reported in several countries; however, the results cannot be generalized because lifestyle and cultural background affect menstrual pain. This study sought to uncover whether 1) different factors, such as emotions and ways of coping with symptoms, vary with the severity of dysmenorrhea and 2) the severity of dysmenorrhea ultimately affects QOL in Japan. A web-based cross-sectional survey was sent to 1000 Japanese females aged 16-30 years. The respondents were divided into two groups: those without dysmenorrhea (n = 24) and those with dysmenorrhea (n = 471). The severity of dysmenorrhea was classified using the Numerical Rating Scale as either mild (1-3), moderate (4-7), or severe (8-10). In total, 156 respondents reported mild dysmenorrhea, 249 reported moderate dysmenorrhea, and 66 reported severe dysmenorrhea. QOL was measured using the 26-item World Health Organization Quality of Life scale. One-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare QOL across different levels of dysmenorrhea severity, depending on normality. Ultimately, significant differences in QOL scores (p<0.001) were observed based on dysmenorrhea severity, with respondents with severe dysmenorrhea reporting the lowest QOL scores. Meanwhile, significant differences were observed in the physical, psychological, and environmental subscales (p<0.001, p<0.001, p = 0.019) across respondents with different levels of dysmenorrhea severity; notably, respondents with severe dysmenorrhea demonstrated a negative spiral of chronic pain, which may significantly impact QOL, and, relatedly, a relatively low psychological QOL. This study is the first to show the relationship between dysmenorrhea severity and QOL in Japanese females, who are more likely to experience negative feelings during menstruation.","We would like to thank the members of the Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences at Hiroshima University for their participation.

Feline HCM closely resembles human HCM and is suggested as translational animal model for the human disease. A genetic cause is established in humans and suspected for cats, but little is known about the gene expression and pathways involved in the pathogenesis of HCM. To investigate the myocardial transcriptome changes in HCM, RNA sequencing was conducted on left ventricle (LV) and left atrium (LA) samples of healthy cats and cats with HCM (each n = 5; 20 samples). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to determine functional pathways, regulators, and networks. Distinct gene expression profiles were identified in the LV and LA of the feline healthy and HCM myocardium. Analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs (>2 fold; FDR < 0.01) found chamber-specific (LV vs. LA) expression in both healthy and HCM groups, with higher transcriptional activity in the LA. Genes that contribute to the distinct structure and function of each chamber in health and HCM were identified in the regional comparison. The gene expression profiles of HCM compared to healthy hearts revealed disease related genes, including THBS4 and KLHL33 (LV), FAM177B and THRSP (LA), the latter 3 have not been reported for the myocardium so far, as the top differently expressed genes in the HCM heart. Differently expressed genes and functional pathways found in the HCM heart are associated with cardiac remodeling and fibrosis, inflammation, microvascular changes, calcium signaling and cardiac metabolism, with some regional differences. RhoGDI-RhoGTPase signaling, integrin and ILK signaling pathways, the LXR/RXR pathway in the LA, and the PPARα/RXRα, HIF1α and CXCR4 pathways in the LV might be of particular importance in the HCM disease process. This study identified region-specific myocardial gene transcription patterns as well as novel genes and pathways associated with HCM.","The authors wish to thank the animal health team at Kingfisher International Inc. for the donation of control cat hearts.

However, the efficacy of this microbe has not yet been determined towards Agrotis exclamationis-a lepidopteran, polyphagous pest, widespread throughout the Palearctic zone. In this work we have detected very low susceptibility of A. exclamationis to B. thuringiensis commercial strains, used as microbial formulations in pest control. To investigate this matter, the biological activity of six selected (Cry1Aa, Cry1Ca, Cry1Ia, Cry2Ab, Cry9Ea and Vip3Aa), heterogously-expressed Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal proteins has been assessed towards A. exclamationis. Only Cry9Ea and Vip3Aa caused significant mortality in the tested pest species, with LC50 values of 950 and 140 ng/cm2, respectively. The histopathological effects of Cry9Ea and Vip3Aa on A. exclamationis were determined. On the other hand, Cry1- and Cry2-type toxins, which are the main active molecules of the majority of currently-used B. thuringiensis-based biocontrol agents (including the commercial strains tested in this work), did not cause mortality in target insect, but only different levels of growth inhibition. Moreover, in the case of Cry1Ca and Cry1Ia hormesis has been observed-a phenomenon that may be disadvantageous in implementation of these proteins in pest management. The obtained results broaden the existing knowledge regarding B. thuringiensis insecticidal protein target range and depict variable susceptibility of A. exclamationis to different groups of Cry/Vip toxins. This work indicates Cry9Ea and Vip3Aa as good candidates for efficient biological control of A. exclamationis and possibly other Agrotinae and discusses the potential use of Vip3-type and Cry9-type insecticidal proteins as successful bioinsecticides.","The authors would like to thank Halina Paetz, Anna Sufryd-Sikora and Renata Sikorska for their technical support.

Hearing loss has substantial impacts on communication, psychological wellbeing, social connectedness, cognition, quality of life, and economic independence. The Hearing impairment in Adults: a Longitudinal Outcomes Study (HALOS) aims to evaluate the: (1) impacts of hearing devices (hearing aids and/or cochlear implants), (2) differences in timing of these interventions and in long-term outcomes between hearing aid and cochlear implant users, and (3) cost-effectiveness of early intervention for adult-onset hearing loss among hearing device users.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: HALOS is a mixed-methods study collecting cross-sectional and longitudinal data on health and social outcomes from 908 hearing aid and/or cochlear implant users aged ≥40 years, recruited from hearing service providers across Australia. The quantitative component will involve an online survey at baseline (time of recruitment), 24-months, and 48-months and will collect audiological, health, psychosocial, functional and employment outcomes using validated instruments. The qualitative component will be conducted in a subset of participants at baseline and involve semi-structured interviews to understand the patient journey and perspectives on the Australian hearing service model.
ETHICS: This study has been approved by the Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee (ID: 11262) and Southern Adelaide Local Health Network (ID: LNR/22/SAC/88). Dissemination of results: Study findings will be disseminated to participants via a one-page summary, and to the public through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences.

From January 1999 to December 2016, a total of 213,986 Taiwanese men aged above 19 years old without history of prostate cancer, urinary tract infection, or prostate infection were recruited from the Taiwan MJ cohort, an ongoing prospective cohort of health examinations conducted by the MJ Health Screening Center in Taiwan. Participants were divided into seven age groups. Simple descriptive statistical analyses were carried out and quartiles and 95th percentiles were calculated for each group as reference ranges for serum PSA in screening for prostate cancer in Taiwanese men. Serum PSA concentration correlated with age (r = 0.274, p<0.001). The median serum PSA concentration (5th to 95th percentile) ranged from 0.7 ng/ml (0.3 to 1.8) for men 20-29 years old (n = 6,382) to 1.6 ng/ml (0.4 to 8.4) for men over 79 years old (n = 504). The age-specific PSA reference ranges are as follows: 20-29 years, 1.80 ng/ml; 30-39 years, 1.80 ng/ml; 40-49 years, 2.0 ng/ml; 50-59 years, 3.20 ng/ml; 60-69 years, 5.60 ng/ml; 70-79 years, 7.40 ng/ml; over 80 years, 8.40 ng/ml. Almost no change occurred in the median serum PSA value in men 50 years old or younger, while a gradual increase was observed in men over 50. Taiwanese men aged 60 years above showed higher 95th percentile serum PSA values compared to Caucasian men and men in other Asian countries but were closer to those of Asian American and African American men. Results indicate significantly different PSA levels correlating to different ethnicities, suggesting that Oesterling's age-specific PSA reference ranges might not be appropriate for Taiwanese men.

We used the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model based on land use, landscape pattern, and ecosystem service value (ESV) to evaluate the spatio-temporal dynamics of sustainable development in Hani traditional ethnic villages from 1995 to 2020. By analyzing changes in sustainability indicators in the Hani area and different buffer zones, this paper aims to assess the impact of ethnic villages in the Hani Area on sustainable development and provide recommendations for the sustainable development of traditional ethnic Hani villages. The results indicated that: (1) The area of construction land and landscape fragmentation in the Hani area significantly increased and the value of ecosystem services and levels of sustainable development decreased each year during the study period; (2) The area of cropland in the 2 km buffer zone of the traditional ethnic villages increased, the degree of landscape fragmentation, the value of ecosystem services, and the level of sustainable development were lower than in the 4 km buffer zone during the study period. This is due to population increases in traditional ethnic Hani villages, as well as the intensive reclamation of cropland, increased construction land, and landscape fragmentation. We suggest that the Hani should implement scientific land planning and management policies to protect the local ecosystem and realize the sustainable development of traditional ethnic Hani villages.","We are grateful for the comments of the anonymous reviewers, which greatly improved the quality of this paper.","This research was funded by the special research project of Chinese Ministry of science (2019QZKK03081) and the key research project of Chinese Ministry of science (2017YFC0505601).

We interrogate the structural and socioeconomic factors associated with vaccine uptake by women farmers in Southeastern Kenya. A mixed methods design with a convergent approach for comparison of quantitative and qualitative findings was adopted. This involved the administration of a cross section survey to 1274 households, conduct of 23 Focus Groups Discussions (FGDs) and 7 Key informant Interviews (KIIs). Chi Square and t-tests were used to identify factors associated with vaccine uptake. Logistics regression analysis was used to identify the influence of the structural and socioeconomic barriers to vaccine uptake. Findings indicate that having knowledge of Newcastle disease (ND) vaccine increases the likelihood of farmers vaccinating their chicken by up to 32.5 times (95% CI [8.46-124.53]) with a 1 unit increase in vaccine knowledge. A farmer's distance away from the nearest ND vaccine vendor was found to reduce the likelihood of farmers vaccinating their chicken by up to 4% (95% CI ([0.93-1.00]) for every 1-kilometre increase in distance away from the vaccine vendors. Farmers who considered vaccines to be effective in preventing ND were 39 times (95% CI [6.23-239.8]) more likely to use ND vaccines than those that did not consider ND vaccine to effective. We surmise that a comprehensive approach that addresses increased ND vaccine knowledge among smallholder women chicken farmers, proximity of ND vendors, as well as cost holds the potential for regular and increased ND vaccine uptake.",,"This project (Grant No. 109063) was funded by The Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund which is supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Global Affairs Canada (GAC), and Canada’s International Development Research Centre.

Data was collected in fall 2021 at a private university. Universal masking, robust contact tracing, vaccination requirement, and enforced testing were in place. Exposures were classified as classroom versus non-classroom. ANOVA and chi-squared tests were used to identify significant relationships between predictors and COVID-19 test result. Logistic regression was conducted to investigate the relationship between exposure type and test result. A total of 162 student cases were identified with 1,658 associated close contacts. One-third of contacts (31.1%, n = 516) only had a non-classroom exposure, 63.8% (n = 1,057) only had a classroom exposure, and 5.1% (n = 85) had both. Close contacts were significantly more likely to test positive if they had a non-classroom exposure (60 of 601; 10.0%) compared to a classroom exposure (1 of 1057; 0.1%) (OR 58.8, CI 18.5-333.3, p < 0.001). Removing physical distancing in classrooms that had universal masking did not result in high rates of COVID-19 transmission. This has policy implications because eliminating physical distancing does not greatly increase transmission risk when universal masking is in place.","The following members of the Saint Louis University Contact Tracing Team assisted in the collection of data for this study/project: Allie Bodin, Sophia Cantwell, Heena Kahn, Emily Killian, Elena Locascio, Ruband Mahmood, Rachel Mazzara, Odiraa Okala, Komal Patel, Kyli Patterson, Pranali Ganesh Patel, and Erin Wheatley.",The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Humans; COVID-19; Physical Distancing; SARS-CoV-2; Universities; Contact Tracing,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0283050,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rebmann, Terri; Loux, Travis M.; Gomel, Ashley; Lugo, Kaeli A.; Bafageeh, Firas; Elkins, Haley; Arnold, Lauren D.","Rebmann, Terri (Institute for Biosecurity, College for Public Health and Social Justice, Saint Louis University, St Louis, Missouri, United States of America; President’s Office, Saint Louis University, St Louis, Missouri, United States of America); Loux, Travis M.

Although earlier evidence suggests SET may suffer from biases due to the gender of professors, there is a lack of large-scale examination to understand how and why gender disparities occur in SET. This study aims to address this gap in SET by analyzing approximately 9 million SET reviews from RateMyProfessors.com under the theoretical frameworks of role congruity theory and shifting standards theory. Our multiple linear regression analysis of the SET numerical ratings confirms that women professors are generally rated lower than men in many fields. Using the Dunning log-likelihood test, we show that words used in student comments vary by the gender of professors. We then use BERTopic to extract the most frequent topics from one- and five-star reviews. Our regression analysis based on the topics reveals that the probabilities of specific topics appearing in SET comments are significantly associated with professors' genders, which aligns with gender role expectations. Furtherly, sentiment analysis indicates that women professors' comments are more positively or negatively polarized than men's across most extracted topics, suggesting students' evaluative standards are subject to professors' gender. These findings contextualize the gender gap in SET ratings and caution the usage of SET in related decision-making to avoid potential systematic biases towards women professors.",We appreciate the valuable comments and suggestions on the manuscript from anonymous reviewers.,Dr. Jibo He is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2022YFB4500600).

Network inference methods typically begin by using the measured time series to assign to any given ordered pair of nodes a numerical score reflecting the likelihood of a directed link between those two nodes. In typical cases, the measured time series data may be subject to limitations, including limited duration, low sampling rate, observational noise, and partial nodal state measurement. However, it is unknown how the performance of link inference techniques on such datasets depends on these experimental limitations of data acquisition. Here, we utilize both synthetic data generated from coupled chaotic systems as well as experimental data obtained from Caenorhabditis elegans neural activity to systematically assess the influence of data limitations on the character of scores reflecting the likelihood of a directed link between a given node pair. We do this for three network inference techniques: Granger causality, transfer entropy, and, a machine learning-based method.

Predicted changes in smoking behavior due to the CTCP were used to predict its effect on health care expenditure. This research updates the model using the most recently available data and estimates CTCP program effect through 2019.
METHODS: The data used in the previous research were updated, and the original model specification and a related predictive forecast model were re-estimated. The updated regression estimates were compared to those previously published and used to update estimates of CTCP program effect in 2019 dollars.
RESULTS: There was no evidence of structural change in the previously estimated model. The estimated effect of the CTCP program expenditures on adult current smoking prevalence and mean consumption per adult current smoker has remained stable over time. Over the life of the program, one additional dollar per capita of program expenditure was associated with a reduction of current adult smoking prevalence by about 0.05 percentage point and mean annual consumption per adult current smoker by about 2 packs. Using updated estimates, the program prevented 9.45 (SE 1.04) million person-years of smoking and cumulative consumption of 15.7 (SE 3.04) billion packs of cigarettes from 1989 to 2019. The program produced cumulative savings in real healthcare expenditure of $544 (SE $82) billion using the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), and $816 (SE $121) billion using the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) measure of medical costs. During this time, the CTCP expenditure was $3.5 billion.
CONCLUSION: A simple predictive model of the effectiveness of the CTCP program remained stable and retains its predictive performance out-of-sample. The updated estimates of program effect suggest that CTCP program has retained its effectiveness over its 31-year life and produced a return on investment of 231 to 1 in direct CMS medical expenditure.",,Supported by California Department of Health and Human Services contract CTCP 19-10620 and National Institute on Drug Abuse grant DA-043950.

We do so to underscore the premise of the social model of disability, which explains that “people are disabled first and foremost by society, not by their individual, biological impairment. To us this term most clearly highlights that it is society (and possibly organizations) that disable and oppress people with impairments, by preventing their access, integration and inclusion to all walks of life, making them ‘disabled’.” (Jammaers and Zanoni, Organization Studies 42:429–452, 2021: 448)) models the growing centrality of the body in meaning-making. We inductively explain how body dramas of suffering or thriving initially instigate cycles of meaning deflation and inflation at work. Our disjunctive process model shows that, at the beginning of the pandemic, disabled workers performed either dramas of suffering or on dramas of thriving. However, as the global pandemic unfolded, disabled workers begun crafting composite dramas that deliberately juxtaposed thriving and suffering. This conjunctive process model stabilized meaning-making at work by acknowledging the duality of the disabled body, as both anomaly and asset. Our findings elaborate, and bridge, emerging theories of body work and recursive meaning-making to explain how disabled workers explicitly enroll their bodies to make meaning at work during periods of societal upheaval.","We are grateful to our handling guest editor, Evgenia Lysova, the guest editorial team of the Special Issue on “Ethics and the Future of Meaningful Work,” and the three anonymous reviewers for their feedback.

A novel antifragility measure of the stock and cryptocurrency markets,"In contrast with robust systems that resist noise or fragile systems that break with noise, antifragility is defined as a property of complex systems that benefit from noise or disorder. Here we define and test a simple measure of antifragility for complex dynamical systems. In this work we use our antifragility measure to analyze real data from return prices in the stock and cryptocurrency markets. Our definition of antifragility is the product of the return price and a perturbation. We explore different types of perturbations that typically arise from within the system. Our results suggest that for both the stock market and the cryptocurrency market, the tendency among the 'top performers' is to be robust rather than antifragile. It would be important to explore other possible definitions of antifragility to understand its role in financial markets and in complex dynamical systems in general.","We are grateful to Ewan Colman, Hyobin Kim and Dante Pérez for interesting discussions and suggestions; and to the C3 community, specially to José Luis Gordillo for providing technical support with the Center’s Cluster usage.","CG - Award from Fundación Marcos Moshinsky A.

Fortunately, early relational trauma is detectable and modifiable. In 2018, Australian Maternal and Child Health (MCH) nurses participated in MERTIL (My Early Relational Trauma-Informed Learning), a program to identify and prevent relational trauma. Program evaluations revealed nurses felt competent and confident to identify and respond to relational trauma; however, response capacity was inhibited by inadequate parent referral options. In response, MERTIL for Parents (My Early Relational Trust-Informed Learning) was developed, which is an online, evidence-based, self-paced parenting program that focuses on enhancing parental knowledge of relational trust and its significance for infant development. This low-cost, accessible prevention resource targets emerging relational concerns to reduce later service system engagement. The potential for universal preventative online programs that target parental and relational wellbeing remains under-explored. This paper reports on a protocol for implementing a MERTIL for Parents pilot study describing practitioners' and parents' perspectives on program feasibility and efficacy.
METHODS: This study is a mixed methods, parallel armed, uncontrolled, repeated measures design. We aim to recruit 48 Australian MCH practitioners from the states of Victoria and New South Wales. These professionals will in turn recruit 480 parents with a child aged 0-5 years. All parents will receive MERTIL for Parents, which entails a 40-minute video, tipsheets, posters, and support resources. Parent data will be obtained at three periods: pre-program, program exit, and program follow-up. Practitioner data will be collected at two periods: pre-parent recruitment and program follow-up. Data collection will occur through surveys and focus groups. Primary parent outcomes will be socioemotional assessments of program efficacy. Practitioners and parents will each report on program feasibility.
DISCUSSION: This protocol describes the feasibility and efficacy of a new online parenting program, MERTIL for Parents, with pilot field studies commencing in March 2023. We anticipate that this resource will be a valuable addition to various child and family services, for use in individual support and group work.","We wish to thank the maternal child health nurses, early childhood mental health clinicians, and parents who co-designed MERTIL for Parents.","YES- JO, JM, and LH received funding from La Trobe University’s (www.latrobe.edu.au) ABC Internal Investment Scheme.

For instance, the formation of root cortical aerenchyma (RCA) significantly increases soil exploration and resource capture by reducing the metabolic costs of root tissue. A key bottleneck in studying such phenotypes has been the lack of robust high-throughput anatomical phenotyping platforms. We exploited a phenotyping approach based on laser ablation tomography, termed Anatomics, to quantify variation in RCA formation of 436 diverse maize lines in the field. Results revealed a significant and heritable variation for RCA formation. Genome-wide association studies identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism mapping to a root cortex-expressed gene-encoding transcription factor bHLH121. Functional studies identified that the bHLH121 Mu transposon mutant line and CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function mutant line showed reduced RCA formation, whereas an overexpression line exhibited significantly greater RCA formation when compared to the wild-type line. Characterization of these lines under suboptimal water and nitrogen availability in multiple soil environments revealed that bHLH121 is required for RCA formation developmentally as well as under studied abiotic stress. Overall functional validation of the bHLH121 gene's importance in RCA formation provides a functional marker to select varieties with improved soil exploration and thus yield under suboptimal conditions.","We thank Robert Snyder, Johan Prinsloo, Samuel Trachsel, and Curtis Frederick for agronomic assistance, and Benjamin Hall, Michael Williams, Andrew Evensen, and Francis Harriman for assistance with LAT and image analysis.

We demonstrate direct inference of full atomic-level protein structure from primary sequence using a large language model. As language models of protein sequences are scaled up to 15 billion parameters, an atomic-resolution picture of protein structure emerges in the learned representations. This results in an order-of-magnitude acceleration of high-resolution structure prediction, which enables large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins. We apply this capability to construct the ESM Metagenomic Atlas by predicting structures for >617 million metagenomic protein sequences, including >225 million that are predicted with high confidence, which gives a view into the vast breadth and diversity of natural proteins.","We thank FAIR team members N.

My analysis suggests the existence of both i) a ""Downsian"" effect, which causes voters to adapt their party preferences based on policy congruence and ii) a ""party identification"" effect, which causes partisans to realign their policy preferences based on ""their"" party's platform. Specifically, I use individual-level panel data to show that i) ""corona skeptical"" voters who did not vote for the FPÖ in the pre-Covid-19 elections of 2019 were more likely to vote for the party after it embraced ""corona populism"", and ii) beliefs of respondents who declared that they voted for the FPÖ in 2019 diverged from the rest of the population in three out of four health-related dimensions only after the turn, causing them to underestimate the threat posed by Covid-19 compared to the rest of the population. Using aggregate-level panel data, I study whether the turn has produced significant behavioral differences which could be observed in terms of reported cases and deaths per capita. Paradoxically, after the turn the FPÖ vote share is significantly positively correlated with deaths per capita, but not with the reported number of infections. I hypothesize that this can be traced back to a self-selection bias in testing, which causes a correlation between the number of ""corona skeptics"" and the share of unreported cases after the turn. I find empirical support for this hypothesis in individual-level data from a Covid-19 prevalence study that involves information about participants' true vs. reported infection status. I finally study a simple heterogeneous mixing epidemiological model and show that a testing bias can indeed explain the apparent paradox of an increase in deaths without an increase in reported cases. My results can, among others, be used to enrich formal analyses regarding the co-evolution between voter and party behavior.","Declaration of Competing Interest None.

These interests went into high gear after empirical evidence was collected that challenged the established paradigm that human brain structures and functions are set from childhood and only modest changes were expected beyond. Early synaptic plasticity rules or laws to that regard include the basic Hebbian rule that proposed a mechanism for strengthening or weakening of synapses (weights) during learning and memory. This rule, however, did not account for the fact that weights must have bounded growth over time. Thereafter, many other rules that possess other desirable properties were proposed to complement the basic Hebbian rule. In particular, a desirable property in a synaptic plasticity rule is that the ambient system must account for inhibition, which is often achieved if the rule used allows for a lower bound in synaptic weights. To that regard, in this letter, we propose such a synaptic plasticity rule that is inspired by the Allee effect, a phenomenon often observed in population dynamics. We show that properties such as synaptic normalization, competition between weights, decorrelation potential, and dynamic stability are satisfied. We show that in fact, an Allee effect in synaptic plasticity can be construed as an absence of plasticity.",,,Neural Computation,,,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,2023-03-16,,,1-34,All OA; Green,Article,"Kwessi, Eddy","Kwessi, Eddy (Department of Mathematics, Trinity University, San Antonio, TX 78212, U.S.A. ekwessi@trinity.edu.)",,"Kwessi, Eddy (Trinity University)",0,0,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.13650,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156385522,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

One of which, BigLEN, is an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor, GPR171. Recent work in rodent models has shown that a small-molecule ligand for GPR171, MS15203, increases morphine antinociception and is effective in lessening chronic pain. While these studies provide evidence for GPR171 as a possible pain target, its abuse liability has not yet been assessed and was evaluated in the current study. We first mapped the distribution of GPR171 and ProSAAS throughout the reward circuit of the brain using immunohistochemistry and showed that GPR171 and ProSAAS are localized in the hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex. In the major dopaminergic structure, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), GPR171 appeared to be primarily localized in dopamine neurons while ProSAAS is outside of dopamine neurons. Next, MS15203 was administered to mice with or without morphine, and VTA slices were stained for the immediate early gene c-Fos as a marker of neuronal activation. Quantification of c-Fos-positive cells revealed no statistical difference between MS15203 and saline, suggesting that MS15203 does not increase VTA activation and dopamine release. The results of a conditioned place preference experiment showed that treatment with MS15203 produced no place preference indicating a lack of reward-related behavior. Taken together this data provides evidence that the novel pain therapeutic, MS15203, has minimal reward liability. Therefore, GPR171 deserves further exploration as a pain target. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: MS15203, a drug that activates the receptor GPR171, was previously shown to increase morphine analgesia. The authors use in vivo and histological techniques to show that it fails to activate the rodent reward circuitry, providing support for the continued exploration of MS15203 as a novel pain drug, and GPR171 a novel pain target.","Acknowledgements We would like to thank Dr. Sanjai Pathak from Queens college, NY for his generous gift of MS15203.

During late-stage differentiation, osteoclasts become multinucleated and enlarged (so-called “maturation”), suggesting their need to adapt to changing metabolic demands and a substantial increase in size. Here, we demonstrate that immunoglobulin superfamily 11 (IgSF11), which is required for osteoclast differentiation through an association with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95, regulates osteoclast differentiation by controlling the activity of pyruvate kinase M isoform 2 (PKM2). By using a system that directly induces the activation of IgSF11 in a controlled manner, we identified PKM2 as a major IgSF11-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. IgSF11 activates multiple Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs), including c-Src, Fyn, and HcK, which phosphorylate PKM2 and thereby inhibit PKM2 activity. Consistently, IgSF11-deficient cells show higher PKM2 activity and defective osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, inhibiting PKM2 activities with the specific inhibitor Shikonin rescues the impaired osteoclast differentiation in IgSF11-deficient cells, and activating PKM2 with the specific activator TEPP46 suppresses osteoclast differentiation in wild-type cells. Moreover, PKM2 activation further suppresses osteoclastic bone loss without affecting bone formation in vivo. Taken together, these results show that IgSF11 controls osteoclast differentiation through PKM2 activity, which is a metabolic switch necessary for optimal osteoclast maturation.",This work was supported partly by NIH grant AR080021 (Y.C.) and The Penn Center for Musculoskeletal Disorders Histology Core (NIH P30-AR069619).,,Bone Research,,,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,11,1,17,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kim, Hyunsoo; Takegahara, Noriko; Choi, Yongwon","Kim, Hyunsoo (Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 19104, Philadelphia, PA, USA); Takegahara, Noriko (Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 19104, Philadelphia, PA, USA); Choi, Yongwon (Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 19104, Philadelphia, PA, USA)","Choi, Yongwon (University of Pennsylvania)","Kim, Hyunsoo (University of Pennsylvania); Takegahara, Noriko (University of Pennsylvania); Choi, Yongwon (University of Pennsylvania)",0,0,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41413-023-00251-2.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156255244,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

This article develops a contingent claims model to examine the impact of the regulatory cap-and-trade mechanism on the green finance strategy of an insurer during a war. Participating in the cap-and-trade scheme of the insurer that funds the borrowing firms also implicitly affects firm production and carbon emissions. The results show that increasing the green loans decreases the interest margin of the insurer but helps policyholder protection. The insurer is reluctant to provide green loans for the green borrowing firm and thus retards sustainable development. A stringent regulatory cap of the cap-and-trade mechanism raises the insurer's interest margin but hurts policyholder protection. From the perspective of the insurer's profit, regulatory cap efficiently derives insurer lending toward sustainability through borrowing-firm cleaner production. An increased war impacting the polluting borrowing firm increases the insurer's interest margin but harms policyholder protection, affecting insurance stability adversely. This research enriches related literature and knowledge concerning insurer green finance practices indirectly associated with cleaner production. The research also highlights the significance of the regulatory cap-and-trade mechanism that reflects cleaner production in affecting insurer performance during a war.",The authors would like to thank the Academic Editor and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

METHODS: The National Program of Cancer Registries and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to determine racial disparity in age adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) of HPSCC and its temporal trend during 2004-2019. Using the separate SEER 17 database, we further evaluated racial disparity in clinicopathological features, and in prognosis using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models.
RESULTS: HPSCC accounted for 95.8% of all hypopharyngeal cancers and occurred much more frequently in males. Its incidence decreased in both male and females, in male non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB) and Hispanic as well as female NHW and NHB during the study period. NHB had the highest, whereas non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islanders (API) had comparable and the lowest incidence in both males and females. Among 6,172 HPSCC patients obtained from SEER 17 database, 80.6% were males and 83.9% were at the advanced stages III/IV. Five-year cancer specific and overall survival rates were 41.2% and 28.9%, respectively. NHB patients were more likely to be younger, unmarried, from the Southern region, larger sized tumor, and at the stage IV, but less likely to receive surgery. They also had higher proportions of dying from HPSCC and all causes. Multivariate analyses revealed that NHB with HPSCC at the locally advanced stage had both significantly worse cancer specific and overall survival compared with NHW, but not at early stage (I/II) or distant metastatic stage. Hispanic patients had significantly better prognosis than NHW at locally advanced and metastatic stages. NHW and API had comparable prognoses.
CONCLUSIONS: HPSCC displays continuously decreased incidence and racial disparity. The majority of the disease is diagnosed at the advanced stage. NHB have the highest burden of HPSCC and a worse prognosis. More studies are needed to curtail racial disparity and improve early detection.",We sincerely thank Dr. Kristin Best for her professional editing of this manuscript.,"This study is supported by The Health Commission of Zhejiang Province (2023KY077); The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript",PLOS ONE,,Female; Humans; Male; Black or African American; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Incidence; Prognosis; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; United States; White; Health Status Disparities,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0282603,All OA; Gold,Article,"Liang, Zhong; Wu, Meijuan; Wang, Peng; Quan, Huatao; Zhao, Jianqiang","Liang, Zhong (Head and Neck Surgery, The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China; Department of Surgery, People’s Hospital of Haixi, Haixi Prefecture, Qinghai, China); Wu, Meijuan (Department of Pathology, The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), The Key Laboratory of Zhejiang Province for Aptamers and Theranostics, Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China); Wang, Peng (Head and Neck Surgery, The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China); Quan, Huatao (Head and Neck Surgery, The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China); Zhao, Jianqiang (Head and Neck Surgery, The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China)","Wu, Meijuan (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)","Liang, Zhong (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Peking University People's Hospital); Wu, Meijuan (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Wang, Peng (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Quan, Huatao (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Zhao, Jianqiang (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282603&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156251036,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

Abnormal GM2 ganglioside accumulation causes progressive deterioration in the central nervous system in Tay-Sachs patients. Hexa-/- mouse model failed to display abnormal phenotype. Recently, our group generated Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mouse showed severe neuropathological indications similar to Tay-Sachs patients. Despite excessive GM2 ganglioside accumulation in the brain and visceral organs, the regulation of autophagy has not been clarified yet in the Tay-Sachs disease mouse model. Therefore, we investigated distinct steps of autophagic flux using markers including LC3 and p62 in four different brain regions from the Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice model of Tay-Sachs disease. Our data revealed accumulated autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes indicating impairment in autophagic flux in the brain.

BACKGROUND: Randomized clinical trials suggest that approximately one third of patients undergoing TAVI do not achieve symptom relief, but ""all-comer"" data are lacking.
METHODS: Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified all citizens, who underwent TAVI from 2008 to 2019 and were alive at 1-year post-discharge. Loop diuretic treatment pre-TAVI and at 1-year post-TAVI were assessed and grouped as receiving 1) no-loop diuretics; 2) low: 1-40 mg of furosemide (or equivalent bumetanide) daily; 3) intermediate: 41-120 mg of furosemide daily; or 4) high: >120 mg furosemide daily.
RESULTS: Among the 4431 patients undergoing TAVI, 2173 (49%) patients were not treated with loop diuretics at the time of TAVI, 918 (21%) had low-loop diuretics, 881 (20%) had intermediate-loop diuretics, and 459 (10%) had high-loop diuretics. At 1-year post-TAVI, 893 (20%) patients had increased, 1010 (23%) had reduced, and 2528 (57%) had unchanged loop diuretic treatment. The cumulative 5-year risk of death in patients surviving one year, was 61% (95% CI: 56.4% to 65.3%) in patients with increased and 47% (95% CI: 44.9% to 49.9%) in patients with reduced/unchanged loop diuretic treatment, respectively. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, increased loop diuretic treatment was associated with a higher risk of death compared with reduced/unchanged loop diuretic treatment (Hazard ratio: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.52).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing TAVI, surviving one year, one fifth of patients had increased loop diuretic treatment, and a little over one fifth had reduced loop diuretic treatment 1-year post-procedure. In patients with increased diuretic treatment, the risk of death was higher compared to those with reduced/unchanged loop diuretic treatment.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Humans; Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement; Aortic Valve Stenosis; Furosemide; Aftercare; Risk Factors; Patient Discharge; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Sodium Potassium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors; Denmark; Treatment Outcome; Aortic Valve,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0282636,All OA; Gold,Article,"Begun, Xenia; Butt, Jawad Haider; Kristensen, Søren Lund; Weeke, Peter Ejvin; De Backer, Ole; Schou, Morten; Køber, Lars; Fosbøl, Emil Loldrup","Begun, Xenia (Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark); Butt, Jawad Haider (Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark); Kristensen, Søren Lund (Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark); Weeke, Peter Ejvin (Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark); De Backer, Ole (Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark); Schou, Morten (Department of Cardiology, Herlev-Gentofte University Hospital, Hellerup, Denmark); Køber, Lars (Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark); Fosbøl, Emil Loldrup (Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark)","Begun, Xenia (Rigshospitalet)","Begun, Xenia (Rigshospitalet); Butt, Jawad Haider (Rigshospitalet); Kristensen, Søren Lund (Rigshospitalet); Weeke, Peter Ejvin (Rigshospitalet); De Backer, Ole (Rigshospitalet); Schou, Morten (Gentofte Hospital); Køber, Lars (Rigshospitalet); Fosbøl, Emil Loldrup (Rigshospitalet)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282636&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156251032,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether real-world and retinal motion affect speed perception in depth and to verify the influence of eye movements on both motion signals in judging speed in depth. We used a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm with two types of tasks. One stimulus moved at a constant speed in the real-world (world constant task) with three conditions: 80-60 cm (far), 60-40 cm (middle), and 40-20 cm (near) from the participant. The other stimulus moved at a constant speed on the retina (retinal constant task) with three conditions: 4-8 deg (far), 8-12 deg (middle), and 12-16 deg (near) as the vergence angle. The results showed that stimulus speed was perceived faster in the near condition than in the middle and far conditions for the world constant task, regardless of whether it was during fixation or convergence eye movements. In contrast, stimulus speed was perceived faster in the order of the far, middle, and near conditions for the retinal constant task. Our results indicate that speed perception of a visual target approaching the observer depends on real-world motion when the target position is relatively far from the observer. In contrast, retinal motion may influence speed perception when the target position is close to the observer. Our results also indicate that the effects of real-world and retinal motion on speed perception for motion in depth are similar with or without convergence eye movements. Therefore, it is suggested that when the visual target moves from far to near, the effects of real-world and retinal motion on speed perception are different depending on the initial target position.",,"This research was supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 19K11460, 22H03492 and JST Grant Number JPMJSP2124.

However, the carcinogenic process remains unclear. By Cap Analysis of Gene Expression method, we found that neonatal DES exposure up-regulated inflammatory Cxcl chemokines 2, 3, 5, and 7 located in the 5qE1 region in the vaginal epithelium of mice 70 days after birth. When we examined the gene expressions of these genes much earlier stages, we found that neonatal DES exposure increased these Cxcl chemokine genes expression even after 17 days after birth. It implies the DES-mediated persistent activation of inflammatory genes. Intriguingly, we also detected DES-induced non-coding RNAs from a region approximately 100 kb far from the Cxcl5 gene. The non-coding RNA up-regulation by DES exposure was confirmed on the 17-day vagina and continued throughout life, which may responsible for the activation of Cxcl chemokines located in the same region, 5qE1. This study shows that neonatal administration of DES to mice causes long-lasting up-regulation of inflammatory Cxcl chemokines in the vaginal epithelium.

Guidelines recommend a blood volume of 8-10 mL per bottle as lower volumes result in decreased sensitivity. We aimed to evaluate factors for non-adherence to recommended volumes and assess the effects on diagnostic performance.
METHODS: From February to April 2020, we measured collected blood volumes by weighing all BC containers from inpatient samples at the University Hospital Basel. Information on BC volumes was merged with clinical and microbiological data, as well as nursing staff schedules. We analyzed factors associated with (i) BC sampling volume, (ii) reaching recommended volumes (≥8 mL), (iii) BC positivity, and (iv) time to positivity using linear and generalized linear mixed effect models.
RESULTS: We evaluated a total of 4'118 BC bottles collected from 686 patients. A total of 1'495 (36.3%) of all bottles contained the recommended filling volume of ≥8 mL. Using a central venous and arterial catheter for drawing blood resulted in an increase of filling volume by 0.26 mL (95% CI 0.10, 0.41) and 0.50 mL (95% CI 0.31, 0.69) compared to peripheral venipuncture, respectively. Each additional nursing staff working at the time of blood drawing was associated with 6% higher odds of achieving the recommended filling volume. We found no significant correlation between the filling volume and the positivity rate.

The grinding time of fly ash raw materials was 0,20,40 and 60 min, respectively. The influence of the grinding degree of the fly ash on the properties and the reaction degree of the geopolymer were investigated by XRD, SEM, EDS, and mercury compression tests. The reaction degree of the fly ash geopolymer was quantified by the selective dissolution method. Increasing the grinding degree of fly ash significantly increased the compressive strength of the geopolymer and the density of the microstructure of materials also increased. Furthermore, porosity and the average pore size decreased and the proportion of small holes in the pores gradually increased. The calculation results were in coincidence with the compressive strength test and the micro-performance test of the material, thus indicating that the selective dissolution method can reflect the influence of the grinding degree on the reaction degree of the geopolymer. Furthermore, the reaction degree of the geopolymer increased as the grinding degree of the fly ash increased. However, the growth rate of the reaction degree for the geopolymer slowed down when the fly ash was ground for more than 40 min.",,"Thanks to the support of Science and Technology Research Project of Education Department of Liaoning province grant, Liaoning province Natural Science Foundation General Project and Project supported by discipline innovation team of Liaoning Technical University for this research.",PLOS ONE,,Coal Ash; Polymers; Mercury; Compressive Strength; Porosity,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0282927,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sun, Qingwei; Zhao, Siyuan; Zhao, Xuzhe; Song, Yu; Ban, Xinyu; Zhang, Ni","Sun, Qingwei (College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin, China); Zhao, Siyuan (College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin, China); Zhao, Xuzhe (College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin, China); Song, Yu (College of Civil Engineering, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Guilin University of Technology, Guilin, China); Ban, Xinyu (College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin, China); Zhang, Ni (College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin, China)","Zhao, Siyuan (Liaoning Technical University)","Sun, Qingwei (Liaoning Technical University); Zhao, Siyuan (Liaoning Technical University); Zhao, Xuzhe (Liaoning Technical University); Song, Yu (Guilin University of Technology); Ban, Xinyu (Liaoning Technical University); Zhang, Ni (Liaoning Technical University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282927&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156251021,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

These models are used to identify statistical dependencies and temporal order of genetic events, which helps design targeted therapies. However, existing algorithms do not account for temporal differences between samples in oncogenetic analysis.

TimedHN models the accumulation process as a continuous-time Markov chain and includes an efficient gradient computation algorithm for optimization. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that TimedHN outperforms current state-of-the-art graph reconstruction methods.

This research incorporates three psychological factors of perceived trust, perceived value, and perceived enjoyment into the technology acceptance model, and explores the influence of these factors on the potential use intention of AVs users. In this study, the questionnaire data from 232 participants were analysed, and the structural equation model test study model was adopted, and nine hypotheses proposed in this study were verified. The results show that perceived enjoyment, perceived trust, perceived usefulness, and attitude have a direct positive impact on users' usage intentions. Perceived value, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use have a direct positive impact on user attitudes. In addition, perceived ease of use has also been shown to directly affect perceived usefulness. This study constructs and demonstrates a model of autonomous vehicle acceptance. This model can be used for user acceptance research of unmanned vehicles. The research expands the theory of technology acceptance model and its applicable fields, and enriches the theory of user research on unmanned vehicles.

The results show that the mediation effects of attention on the relationships between rhetorical devices and affective and cognitive elaborations are moderated by involvement. Nonnarrative evidence, combined narrative and numerical evidence, source credibility, and tropes versus the lack of figures of speech, elicit better audience responses in low-involvement situations, whereas numerical evidence outperforms narratives in high-involvement situations.

METHODS: This study included patients with CBD stones who underwent ERCP at Pattani Hospital between August 2017 and December 2021. Retrospective cohort data was collected and patients were categorized into two groups: bile duct stones successfully treated by endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy and extraction compared to the former method combined with EPLBD. We explored potential predictors using multivariable logistic regression. The chosen logistic coefficients were transformed into a scoring system based on risk with internal validation via bootstrapping procedure.
RESULTS: Among the 155 patients who had successful endoscopic therapy for bile duct stones, there were 79 (50.97%) cases of endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy, EPLBD and extraction versus 76 (49.03%) cases without EPLBD. The factors used to derive a scoring system included the size of CBD stones >15 mm, the difference between the stone and distal CBD diameter >2mm, distal CBD arm length <36 mm and stone shape. The score-based model's area under ROC was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.93). For clinical use, the range of scores from 0 to 16, was divided into two subcategories based on CBD stone removal difficulty requiring EPLBD to derive the PPV. For scores <5 and ≥ 5, the PPV was 23.40 (p <0.001) and 93.44 (p <0.001) respectively. The Bootstrap sampling method indicated a prediction ability of 0.88 (AuROC, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.94).

In this article, we utilize several datasets to provide the first systematic investigation of the urban scaling of manufacturing industries in China. Most existing literature assumes that the divergence in urban scaling can be explained by returns to agglomeration, with a few exceptions instead highlighting the role of knowledge complexity or a mixture of both. Our main purpose in this paper is to explain the inter-sector variation of urban scaling rates. In doing this, we provide a clearer approach to demonstrating the relations between urban scaling, returns to agglomeration, and knowledge complexity. Our findings are twofold. First, after uncovering the scaling rates (denoted as urban concentration) and returns to agglomeration (denoted as urban productivity) for each sub-manufacturing sector, we prove that, rather than being a positive predictor, returns to agglomeration is slightly negatively associated with urban scaling rates. This finding reveals that urban concentration of manufacturing may not simply be a natural consequence driven by the maximization of performance. We also show that this result of the manufacturing system contrasts with what would be found in other pure knowledge systems such as patents. Secondly, we measure the complexity for each sector and demonstrate that the variation of urban concentration can be largely explained by their complexity, consistent with the knowledge complexity perspective. Specifically, complex manufacturing sectors are found to concentrate more in large cities than less complex sectors in China. This result provides support for the view that the growth of complex activities hinges more on diversity than on efficiency. The findings above can greatly reduce the current level of ambiguity associated with urban scaling, returns to agglomeration and complexity, and have important policy implications for urban planners, highlighting the significance of a more balanced and diversified configuration of urban productive activities for the growth of innovation economy.",We gratefully acknowledge the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions.

The build-up of the target percept is influenced by the masker and target properties. Most studies dealing with discrimination performance neglect the dynamics of perceptual awareness. This study aims at investigating the dynamics of perceptual awareness using multi-level survival models in an informational masking paradigm by manipulating masker uncertainty, masker-target similarity and target repetition rate. Consistent with previous studies, it shows that high target repetition rates, low masker-target similarity and low masker uncertainty facilitate target detection. In the context of evidence accumulation models, these results can be interpreted by changes in the accumulation parameters. The probabilistic description of perceptual awareness provides a benchmark for the choice of target and masker parameters in order to examine the underlying cognitive and neural dynamics of perceptual awareness.",We wish to thank B.

However, the current machining methods for freeform are difficult to meet the requirements of optical use. Based on a developed fast servo tool (FTS) device, this paper proposes an error compensation turning method for freeforms. Firstly, the Zernike polynomial fitting method is used to reconstruct the freeform surface shape error obtained from off-line measurement, and the offset compensation is used to correct the tool path. Then, the compensation processing physical system is built to simulate the off-line compensation processing of the workpiece to verify the feasibility of compensation processing. Finally, the turning compensation processing of convex freeform aluminum mirror is carried out, and the surface accuracy of the workpiece meets the requirements of visible band.

The classical packing solution method relies on heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms. Usually, it needs to be designed with manual decisions to guide the solution, resulting in a small solution scale, weak generalization, and low solution efficiency. Inspired by deep learning and reinforcement learning, combined with the characteristics of rectangular piece packing, a novel algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed in this work to solve the rectangular strip packing problem. The pointer network with an encoder and decoder structure is taken as the basic network for the deep reinforcement learning algorithm. A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm is designed to train network parameters to optimize the packing sequence. This design can not only avoid designing heuristic rules separately for different problems but also use the deep networks with self-learning characteristics to solve different instances more widely. At the same time, a piece positioning algorithm based on the maximum rectangles bottom-left (Maxrects-BL) is designed to determine the placement position of pieces on the plate and calculate model rewards and packing parameters. Finally, instances are used to analyze the optimization effect of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce three better and five comparable results compared with some classical heuristic algorithms. In addition, the calculation time of the proposed algorithm is less than 1 second in all test instances, which shows a good generalization, solution efficiency, and practical application potential.",The authors would like to thank the referees for their constructive comments that improved the presentation as well as the content of the paper.,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number. 51975231) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant number. 2019 kfyXKJC043).

This study attempts to construct a ferroptosis-associated signature associated with overall survival (OS) that can predict the prognosis of LUSC and explore its relationship with immune infiltration. A 5 ferroptosis-associated gene model was constructed by LASSO-penalized regression analysis to predict the prognosis of patients with LUSC in the TCGA database and validated in the GEO and TCGA databases. Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups by the median value of the risk scores, and the former prognosis was significantly worse (P<0.001). Additionally, we found a certain association between the two risk groups and immune infiltration through CIBERSORT. Meanwhile, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal and tumor tissue were used to perform functional analysis, which showed a significant association with leukocyte transendothelial migration pathways in the TCGA cohort. In addition, immune cell infiltration analysis confirmed that M2 macrophages were significantly highly expressed in the high-risk group.

However, studies have demonstrated discordance between self-reported measures and biomedical benchmarks of PrEP adherence. We estimated the correlation between self-reported PrEP adherence and PrEP biomarkers and explored factors associated with adherence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Nigeria.
METHODS: TRUST-PrEP, an open-label, prospective study; conducted in Abuja between April 2018 and May 2019. MSM ≥ 18 years with substantial HIV risk were enrolled. Participants reported PrEP adherence in the last month using a 4-point scale from ""poor"" to ""perfect"" and serum samples for PrEP biomarkers were collected at months 3 and 9. Serum tenofovir concentration was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and considered protective for adherence if ≥ 4.2 ng/ml. Spearman's rank correlation was used to estimate correlation between self-reported adherence and measured tenofovir levels. Generalized estimating equations with a logit link was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between self-reported adherence and laboratory-measured adherence.
RESULTS: A total of 219 MSM with median age 23 (interquartile range 20-27) years had at least one PrEP biomarker assay. Only 66/219 (30%) had at least one record of protective tenofovir concentration. Correlation between tenofovir and self-reported adherence at 3 and 9 months were 0.1 and 0.02 respectively. Furthermore, 17/219 (8%,) and 49/219 (22%) had serum tenofovir of 4.2-35.4 ng/mL and ≥ 35.5 ng/mL, corresponding to at least 4 and 7 days' PrEP use in a week, respectively. PrEP adherence was higher among participants introduced to PrEP in the clinics compared with communities (aOR: 8.35, 95%CI: [3.24, 21.5]) and those with same-sex practices family disclosure (aOR: 3.60 95% CI: [1.73, 7.51]).
CONCLUSION: Self-reported PrEP adherence poorly correlated with biomarkers. Facilitating clinic-based PrEP introduction and disclosure of same-sex practices to family among MSM may improve PrEP adherence.","The authors thank the study participants, Mr. Ruxton Adebiyi and the staff of TRUST/RV368 clinics for their time and efforts in this study.

Each layer becomes metabolically inert, capturing the ratio of heavy/light carbon and nitrogen isotopes at time of formation. Therefore, eye lenses contain chronological isotopic records and can be used to create a temporal isotopic history throughout an individual's lifetime. We analyzed eye lens amino-acid δ15N to address spatio-temporal baseline variability and to reconstruct trophic histories of 10 individual Red Snapper. Proteins from sequential eye lens laminae were derivatized to measure 10 amino acids, from which glutamic acid (trophic) and phenylalanine (source) were used to estimate trophic positions at different points in life. Best-fitting regressions were generated to represent individual (R2 ≥ 0.89) and generalized (R2 = 0.77) trophic trajectory for Red Snapper. The resulting trophic trajectories indicated an increase in trophic position with increasing length. Until recently, there has not been a lifetime isotopic structure with enough organic nitrogen to recreate geographic histories using compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA). This study confirms that eye-lens laminae can be used to reconstruct trophogeographic histories via CSIA-AA.","Thank you to Dr. Steve Murawski, the “Mud and Blood” crew, and the crew of the R/V Weatherbird for the long days and demanding schedule required for sample collection.

This study examined the association between abdominal obesity and the risk of developing gliomas in diabetic patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National Health Insurance System of South Korea from 2009 to 2012. The primary outcome was the incidence of newly diagnosed gliomas according to waist circumference (WC), and subgroup analyses were performed according to demographic characteristics and diabetes status including disease duration, number of oral hypoglycemic agents, and insulin use.
RESULTS: Of a total of 1,893,057 participants, 1,846 (0.10%) cases of gliomas occurred. After adjusting for confounding factors, WC ≥90 cm (men)/85 cm (women) was associated with significantly higher risks of gliomas (adjusted HR [95% CI]; 1.279 [1.053, 1.554], 1.317 [1.048, 1.655], and 1.369 [1.037, 1.807] in the WC <95 cm (men)/90 cm (women) group, WC <100 cm (men)/95 cm (women) group, and WC ≥100 cm (men)/95 cm (women) group, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with larger WC had a consistently higher incidence of glioma than their lean counterparts, except for insulin users (insulin user vs. nonuser, P for interaction = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal obesity was associated with the development of gliomas in diabetic patients in a nationwide population-based database. Further study is needed in diabetic patients to stratify the risk for glioma development according to WC and to establish the underlying mechanism of carcinogenesis.",The authors appreciate Korea National Health Insurance Corporation for providing the data.

Vitamin E is the most abundant lipid-soluble antioxidant present in the blood. However, the association of vitamin E status with BMD in children and adolescents remains unclear.
METHODS: We first measured the association of vitamin E status (serum α- and γ tocopherol) with BMD in children and adolescents with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Multiple linear regression models were performed to evaluate their relationship after adjusting for a large range of covariates. Stratified analyses and interaction tests were used to explore their effects on different genders, ages, and races/ethnicities.
RESULTS: 13,606 children and adolescents from NHANES (2005-2006, 2017-2018) were included in our analysis. Compared with the lowest α-tocopherol quartile, individuals in the highest α-tocopherol quartile are likelier to be Non-Hispanic White and have a higher value of poverty income ratio (PIR). They have a lower value of serum phosphorus and lumbar spine BMD. Every 1umol/L increase in serum α- and γ- tocopherol, the lumbar spine BMD decreased by -0.0016 and -0.0068 g/cm2. Compared with the lowest quartile serum α- and γ- tocopherol concentration, individuals in the highest quartile have a -0.0223 and -0.0329 g/cm2 lower mean BMD, respectively. Interaction effects suggest that the negative effect is more prominent among female youth, individuals aged 8-13 years, non-Hispanic whites, Mexican Americans, and non-Hispanic blacks.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates serum α- and γ-tocopherol are negatively correlated with lumbar BMD. Age, gender, and race may have a modifying effect on this relationship. Our study has an important clinical implication. A higher vitamin E status for children and adolescents could not improve BMD, even decrease BMD.

We hypothesized that off-hours, which includes night-time, weekends, and holidays, may influence mortality in TBI. Our study aimed to evaluate if the off-hours effect influences mortality in patients with TBI and whether this effect is dependent on the age group.
METHODS: This study included patients who experienced TBI and were admitted to Chonnam National University Hospital (CNUH) between 2017 to 2020. The main exposure was arrival time at the emergency department (ED) (off-hours vs. working hours). The main outcome was mortality at hospital discharge. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to estimate the effect size of off-hours on mortality compared to that of working hours. We performed an interaction analysis between ED admission time and age group on study outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 2086 patients with TBI with intracranial injury who were transported by EMS were enrolled in our registry. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, there was no significant difference in mortality (AOR, 95% CI (1.05 [0.54-1.81]) in patients visiting the ED during off-hours. In the interaction analysis, the effect measure of ED admission during off-hours on mortality was significant among younger people (0-17 years: 1.16 [1.03-1.31]), compared to that in other age groups (18-64 years: 1.02 [0.48-2.39] and 65-100 years (0.99 [0.51-2.23])).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients under 18 years old, admission during off-hours was associated with higher mortality at hospital discharge compared to admission during working-hours in patients with TBI with intracranial hemorrhage.

AIM: This study aims to create an automatic fundus macular image enhancement framework to improve low-quality fundus images and remove complex image degradation.
METHOD: We propose a new deep learning-based model that automatically enhances low-quality retinal fundus images that suffer from complex degradation. We collected a dataset, comprising 1068 pairs of high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) fundus images from the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital's health screening program and ophthalmology department from 2017 to 2019. Then, we used these dataset to develop data augmentation methods to simulate major aspects of retinal image degradation and to propose a customized convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to enhance LQ images, depending on the nature of the degradation. Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), r-value (linear index of fuzziness), and proportion of ungradable fundus photographs before and after the enhancement process are calculated to assess the performance of proposed model. A comparative evaluation is conducted on an external database and four different open-source databases.
RESULTS: The results of the evaluation on the external test dataset showed an significant increase in PSNR and SSIM compared with the original LQ images. Moreover, PSNR and SSIM increased by over 4 dB and 0.04, respectively compared with the previous state-of-the-art methods (P < 0.05). The proportion of ungradable fundus photographs decreased from 42.6% to 26.4% (P = 0.012).

Therefore, the dynamics process of the change of the resident group intention to retrofit and its impact on the behavior of the tripartite game between the government, investment retrofitting enterprises and residents needs to be analyzed. Firstly, a dissemination model of green retrofitting intentions among resident groups is constructed, and it is coupled with the tripartite game model. Then, through numerical simulation, the dissemination laws of intention for green retrofitting among resident groups and its influence on the evolution process of the tripartite game are analyzed. The results show that: (1) The rate at which the triad of government, investment retrofitting enterprises and residents reaches steady state is influenced by the impact of changes in the level of social climate on the rate of conversion of potential and participating residents to immune residents. When the rate of enterprises investment and residents participation increases, the rate of government choice of incentive strategies decreases; (2) greater government regulation and subsidies will increase the intention of residents and retrofitting enterprises to participate. The ideal steady state without government incentives can be achieved when the group size of participating residents is increased by improving the level of government publicity and education and the technology level of the enterprises; (3) the intention of enterprises to invest is closely related to the cognitive benefits and the level of risk perception of residents.

Recent trends in global energy prices and discussions on climate change highlight the need to reduce our energy footprint associated with the use of supplemental light in greenhouse crop production. This can be achieved by implementing ""smart"" lighting regimens which in turn rely on a good understanding of how fluctuating light influences photosynthetic physiology. Here, a simple fit-for-purpose dynamic model is presented. It accurately predicts net leaf photosynthesis under natural fluctuating light. It comprises two ordinary differential equations predicting: 1) the total stomatal conductance to CO2 diffusion and 2) the CO2 concentration inside a leaf. It contains elements of the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry model and the successful incorporation of this model suggests that for tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), it is sufficient to assume that Rubisco remains activated despite rapid fluctuations in irradiance. Furthermore, predictions of the net photosynthetic rate under both 400ppm and enriched 800ppm ambient CO2 concentrations indicate a strong correlation between the dynamic rate of photosynthesis and the rate of electron transport.

The goal of this study was to examine the feasibility of and adherence to a 15-week telephone-based weight loss intervention in rural Ohio, an area with high rates of obesity.
METHODS: This pilot 2-arm randomized controlled study was designed for rural Ohio residents who were overweight or obese. Eligible participants were 2:1 randomly assigned to either a 15-week weight loss intervention group or active control group. The weight loss intervention group received weekly telephone sessions to improve healthy diet and increase physical activity. The active control group received education brochures with information on physical activity and dietary guidelines. Feasibility was defined as at least 80% of participants completing the follow-up surveys, and acceptable adherence was defined as the percentage of participants in the weight loss group who attend ≥75% of weekly telephone sessions.
RESULTS: A total of 423 individuals entered the online screening survey, 215 (50.8%) completed the survey, and 98 (45.6%) of those were eligible. Forty eligible individuals were enrolled and randomly assigned to the weight loss group (n = 27) or active control group (n = 13). The average age of the weight loss group was 49 (SD = 10) years, and 89% were female. The average age of the active control group was 51 (SD = 9) years, and 92% were female. Feasibility was demonstrated: 90% of participants completed the online follow-up surveys at 15-weeks. Among participants in the weight loss group, 22 out of 27 (81.5%) completed the 15-week intervention, the average number of sessions attended was 9.7 (64.9%). Adherence to the intervention was rated as acceptable among almost half of the group (48.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: Feasibility of a 15-week telephone-based weight loss study among rural residents with overweight/obesity were determined. A future study will test this intervention for weight loss efficacy.","We acknowledge Dr. Justin C. Brown and Dr. Jennifer A.

Imperfect translation from rodent models and lack of in vitro models of toxicity has limited investigation of autophagic flux dysregulation, preventing design of novel cardioprotective strategies based on autophagy control. Development of an adult heart tissue culture technique from a translational model will improve investigation of cardiac toxicity. We aimed to optimize a canine cardiac slice culture system for exploration of cancer therapy impact on intact cardiac tissue, creating a translatable model that maintains autophagy in culture and is amenable to autophagy modulation. Canine cardiac tissue slices (350 μm) were generated from left ventricular free wall collected from euthanized client-owned dogs (n = 7) free of cardiovascular disease at the Foster Hospital for Small Animals at Tufts University. Cell viability and apoptosis were quantified with MTT assay and TUNEL staining. Cardiac slices were challenged with doxorubicin and an autophagy activator (rapamycin) or inhibitor (chloroquine). Autophagic flux components (LC3, p62) were quantified by western blot. Cardiac slices retained high cell viability for >7 days in culture and basal levels of autophagic markers remained unchanged. Doxorubicin treatment resulted in perturbation of the autophagic flux and cell death, while rapamycin co-treatment restored normal autophagic flux and maintained cell survival. We developed an adult canine cardiac slice culture system appropriate for studying the effects of autophagic flux that may be applicable to drug toxicity evaluations.",We thank Dr. Elizabeth Rozanski for harvesting the canine heart through the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University tissue donation program and the pet owners for donating their pets’ tissues to the tissue donation program.,"National Institutes of Health (https://www.nih.gov/): HHC: K99/R00HL121152 VKY: K01OD028205-01 IZJ and CAL: 1R01CA243542-01 JNU: K08HL146959 The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",PLOS ONE,,"Animals; Dogs; Myocytes, Cardiac; Cardiotoxicity; Autophagy; Doxorubicin; Sirolimus",2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0282859,All OA; Gold,Article,"Boukhalfa, Asma; Robinson, Sally R.; Meola, Dawn M.; Robinson, Nicholas A.; Ling, Lauren A.; LaMastro, Joey N.; Upshaw, Jenica N.; Pulakat, Lakshmi; Jaffe, Iris Z.; London, Cheryl A.; Chen, Howard H.; Yang, Vicky K.","Boukhalfa, Asma (Molecular Cardiology Research Institute, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America); Robinson, Sally R.

Consider a learning task where error-cancelling strategies incur higher effort costs, specifically where subjects reach to targets in a force field. Concluding that those with greater error have learned less has a critical assumption: everyone uses the same error-canceling strategy. Alternatively, it could be that those with greater error may be choosing to sacrifice error reduction in favor of a lower effort movement. Here, we test this hypothesis in a dataset that includes both younger and older adults, where older adults exhibited greater kinematic errors. Utilizing the framework of optimal control theory, we infer subjective costs (i.e., strategies) and internal model accuracy (i.e., proportion of the novel dynamics learned) by fitting a model to each population's trajectory data. Our results demonstrate trajectories are defined by a combination of the amount learned and strategic differences represented by relative cost weights. Based on the model fits, younger adults could have learned between 65-90% of the novel dynamics. Critically, older adults could have learned between 60-85%. Each model fit produces trajectories that match the experimentally observed data, where a lower proportion learned in the model is compensated for by increasing costs on kinematic errors relative to effort. This suggests older and younger adults could be learning to the same extent, but older adults have a higher relative cost on effort compared to younger adults. These results call into question the proposition that older adults learn less than younger adults and provide a potential explanation for the equivocal findings in the literature. Importantly, our findings suggest that the metrics commonly used to probe motor learning paint an incomplete picture, and that to accurately quantify the learning process the subjective costs of movements should be considered.",A special thanks to Helen Huang for sharing her dataset.,"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the form of a Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) grant to AAA and MB [1200830] and a CAREER, Social and Economic Sciences (SES) grant to AAA [1352632].

Thus, standard deviation used for computing percentiles (e.g., 10th, 90th) is assumed to be proportional to the customized mean, although this assumption has never been formally tested.
METHODS: In a secondary analysis of NICHD Fetal Growth Studies-Singletons (12 U.S. sites, 2009-2013) using longitudinal sonographic biometric data (n = 2288 pregnancies), we investigated the assumptions of normality and constant coefficient of variation by examining behavior of the mean and standard deviation, computed following the Gardosi method. We then created a more flexible model that customizes both mean and standard deviation using heteroscedastic regression and calculated customized percentiles directly using quantile regression, with an application in a separate study of 102, 012 deliveries, 37-41 weeks.
RESULTS: Analysis of term optimal birthweight challenged assumptions of proportionality and that values were normally distributed: at different mean birthweight values, standard deviation did not change linearly with mean birthweight and the percentile computed with the normality assumption deviated from empirical percentiles. Composite neonatal morbidity and mortality rates in relation to birthweight < 10th were higher for heteroscedastic and quantile models (10.3% and 10.0%, respectively) than the Gardosi model (7.2%), although prediction performance was similar among all three (c-statistic 0.52-0.53).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings question normality and constant coefficient of variation assumptions of the Gardosi customization method. A heteroscedastic model captures unstable variance in customization characteristics which may improve detection of abnormal growth percentiles.

How can we generate new tailored bundles for users? Recommending a bundle, or a group of various items, has attracted widespread attention in e-commerce owing to the increased satisfaction of both users and providers. Bundle matching and bundle generation are two representative tasks in bundle recommendation. The bundle matching task is to correctly match existing bundles to users while the bundle generation is to generate new bundles that users would prefer. Although many recent works have developed bundle recommendation models, they fail to achieve high accuracy since they do not handle heterogeneous data effectively and do not learn a method for customized bundle generation. In this paper, we propose BundleMage, an accurate approach for bundle matching and generation. BundleMage effectively mixes user preferences of items and bundles using an adaptive gate technique to achieve high accuracy for the bundle matching. BundleMage also generates a personalized bundle by learning a generation module that exploits a user preference and the characteristic of a given incomplete bundle to be completed. BundleMage further improves its performance using multi-task learning with partially shared parameters. Through extensive experiments, we show that BundleMage achieves up to 6.6% higher nDCG in bundle matching and 6.3× higher nDCG in bundle generation than the best competitors. We also provide qualitative analysis that BundleMage effectively generates bundles considering both the tastes of users and the characteristics of target bundles.",,"This work was supported by Jung-Hun Foundation.

Such a relationship could have an outsized impact in high-prevalence TB settings. However, few studies have explored this relationship in populations heavily burdened by diabetes and TB.
METHODS: We analyzed data from a community-based population cohort that enrolled adults in rural South Africa. Individuals were considered to have prior TB if they self-reported a history of TB treatment. We fitted sex-specific logistic regression models, adjusted for potential clinical and demographic confounders, to estimate relationships between dysglycemia (HBA1c ≥6.5%) and prior TB. Propensity score-matched cohorts accounted for the differential age distributions between comparator groups. We examined the interactions between sex, prior TB, and HIV status.
RESULTS: In the analytic cohort (n = 17,593), the prevalence of prior TB was 13.8% among men and 10.7% among women. Dysglycemia was found in 9.1% of the population, and HIV prevalence was 34.0%. We found no difference in dysglycemia prevalence by prior TB (men OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.60-1.56: women OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.79-1.39). However, there was a qualitative interaction by HIV serostatus, such that among men without HIV, those with a history of TB had a greater prevalence of dysglycemia than those without prior TB (10.1% vs. 4.6%, p = 0.0077). An inverse relationship was observed among men living with HIV (prior TB 3.3% vs. no TB 7.3%, p = 0.0073).
CONCLUSIONS: Treated TB disease was not associated with dysglycemia in an HIV-endemic, rural South African population. However, we found a significant interaction between prior TB and HIV status among men, suggesting distinct pathophysiological mechanisms between the two infections that may impact glucose metabolism. Longitudinal studies are needed to better establish a causal effect and underlying mechanisms related to resolved TB, HIV, and diabetes.","We thank the residents of the Africa Health Research Institute demographic surveillance area and members of the Vukuzazi Study Team who collected these data.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study with 159 patients (133 with ovarian and 26 with non-ovarian tumors) who underwent surgery/biopsy for an adnexal mass. Preoperative CA125 and CEA serum measurements were obtained and a pelvic/abdominal ultrasound was performed. Preoperative pelvic MR studies were performed for all patients. Morphological and advanced MR sequences were obtained. Using a recursive partitioning algorithm to predict tumor origin, we devised a roadmap to determine the probability of non-ovarian origin using only statistically significant US, laboratory and MR parameters.
RESULTS: Upfront US classification as ovarian versus non-ovarian and CA125/CEA ratio were significantly associated with non-ovarian tumors. Signal diffusion (absent/low versus high) was the only MR parameter significantly associated with non-ovarian tumors. When upfront US designated a tumor as being of ovarian origin, further MR signal diffusion and CA125/CEA ratio were corrected nearly all US errors: patients with MR signal diffusion low/absent and those with signal high but CA125/CEA ratio ≥25 had an extremely low chance (<1%) of being of non-ovarian origin. However, for women whose ovarian tumors were incorrectly rendered as non-ovarian by upfront US, neither MR nor CA125/CEA ratio were able to determine tumor origin precisely.
CONCLUSION: MR signal diffusion is an extremely useful MR parameter to help determine adnexal mass origin when US and laboratory findings are inconclusive.",,"author: SFD number 2012/15059-8 São Paulo Research Foundation, Fapesp https://fapesp.br the funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",PLOS ONE,,"Humans; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ovarian Neoplasms; Adnexal Diseases; CA-125 Antigen; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Biomarkers, Tumor",2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0283212,All OA; Gold,Article,"Pereira, Patrick Nunes; Derchain, Sophie Françoise; Yoshida, Adriana; de Oliveira Barros, Ricardo Hoelz; Jales, Rodrigo Menezes; Sarian, Luís Otávio","Pereira, Patrick Nunes (Faculty of Medical Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, State University of Campinas—Unicamp, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil; Section of Imaging, Sumaré State Hospital, State University of Campinas, Sumaré, São Paulo, Brazil); Derchain, Sophie Françoise (Faculty of Medical Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, State University of Campinas—Unicamp, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil); Yoshida, Adriana (Faculty of Medical Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, State University of Campinas—Unicamp, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil); de Oliveira Barros, Ricardo Hoelz (Section of Imaging, Sumaré State Hospital, State University of Campinas, Sumaré, São Paulo, Brazil); Jales, Rodrigo Menezes (Faculty of Medical Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, State University of Campinas—Unicamp, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil); Sarian, Luís Otávio (Faculty of Medical Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, State University of Campinas—Unicamp, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil)","Yoshida, Adriana (State University of Campinas)","Pereira, Patrick Nunes (State University of Campinas; State University of Campinas); Derchain, Sophie Françoise (State University of Campinas); Yoshida, Adriana (State University of Campinas); de Oliveira Barros, Ricardo Hoelz (State University of Campinas); Jales, Rodrigo Menezes (State University of Campinas); Sarian, Luís Otávio (State University of Campinas)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283212&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156250965,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,

Bats worldwide are declining due to disease, habitat destruction, and climate change, and many species lack reliable population information to guide management decisions. Current approaches for estimating population sizes of bats in densely occupied colonies are time-intensive, may negatively impact the population due to disturbance, and/or have low accuracy. Research-based video tracking options are rarely used by conservation or management agencies for animal counting due to the perceived training and elevated operating costs. In this paper, we present BatCount, a free software program created in direct consultation with end-users designed to automatically count bats emerging from cave roosts (historical populations 20,000-250,000) with a streamlined and user-friendly interface. We report on the software package and provide performance metrics for different recording habitat conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that BatCount is an efficient and reliable option for counting bats in flight, with performance hundreds of times faster than manual counting, and has important implications for range- and species-wide population monitoring. Furthermore, this software can be extended to count any organisms moving across a camera including birds, mammals, fish or insects.","The authors would like to thank Z-Bar Ranch, Melynda Hickman, Missouri Department of Conservation, Tumbling Creek Cave Foundation, John and Jean Swindell, and Mark and Daniel Mauss for access to field recordings, Jordan Meyer, Dave Woods, Stephanie Dreessen, Cassi Mardis, and Cory Holliday for assistance with video collection, Jim Cooley and the Cave Research Foundation for field assistance, and Lindsey McGovern and Zachary Ahmida for manual counting.

Social anxiety, a facet of anxiety associated with social withdrawal, may be a predictor of itch intensity in this patient group. Moreover, anxiety is linked to the secretion of neuroendocrine and inflammatory parameters such as substance P (SP), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17, which are also related to itch. In this research project, we investigate first, whether there is a direct relationship between social anxiety and itch intensity in patients with PSO and second whether the secretion of SP, IL-6 and IL-17 in the skin mediates this relationship. Additionally, PSO-patients are compared to healthy skin controls regarding their level of social anxiety, itch intensity and the secretion of SP, IL-6 and IL-17.
METHODS AND ANALYSES: For study 1, we aim to recruit 250 psoriasis patients and 250 healthy skin controls who complete questionnaires to assess social anxiety, itch intensity and control variables (e.g. sociodemographic variables and severity of PSO). A linear hierarchic regression will be used to determine whether social anxiety significantly contributes to itch intensity. In study 2, we plan to apply the suction blister method to 128 patients and healthy skin controls recruited from study 1 to determine SP, IL-6 and IL-17 in tissue fluid extracted from the skin. A mediation analysis will be conducted using the SPSS-macro PROCESS to test whether the relationship between social anxiety and itch is mediated by SP, IL-6 and IL-17.

Development of Estonian trigger tool for multimorbid patients. A study protocol for mixed-methods study,"INTRODUCTION: It is widely recognized that providing healthcare may produce harm to the patient. Different approaches have been developed to measure the burden of adverse events (AEs) to plan and measure the effects of interventions. One of the most widely used instruments is the Trigger Tool, which has previously been modified to be used on various settings and translated into many languages. Multimorbidity complicates care and may increase the number of AEs patients experience. Currently there is no instrument designed to measure AEs in multimorbid patients. In Estonia, there is currently no validated instrument to measure the burden of AEs.
AIMS: The aim of this study will be evaluating the characteristics and ocurrence of AEs in multimorbid patients in hospitalised internal medicine patients of Estonia, and describes the development of a trigger tool for this purpose.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search for the evidence on measuring AEs in the population of multimorbid patients focusing on trigger tools, and synthesize the data. Data collection of the triggers from the literature will be followed by translating triggers from English to Estonian. An expert multidisciplinary panel will select the suitable triggers for this population. Trigger tool will be pre-tested to assess agreement among professionals and usability of the tool. Validation will be done using 90 medical records. A cross-sectional study in internal medicine departments of two Estonian tertiary care hospitals will be performed to identify the frequency and characteristics of AEs in 960 medical records. We will also provide preventability potential and influencing factors.

This paper uses the kernel density estimation, exploratory spatial data analysis, and spatial econometric models to analyze the characteristics of dynamic evolution and the spillover effects of the infrastructure resilience levels in 283 prefecture-level and above cities in China from 2010 to 2019. Our results are as follows. (1) The overall level of urban infrastructure resilience increased. The eastern region had a higher level than the national average. In contrast, the central, western and north-eastern regions had a slightly lower level than the national average. (2) The areas with high and higher resilience levels were mostly cities with more developed economic and social conditions in Eastern China. The areas below moderate resilience levels show a certain degree of clustering and mainly include some cities in Central, Western, and Northeast China. (3) The national level of urban infrastructure resilience shows significant spatial clustering characteristics, and the spatial pattern from coastal to inland regions presents a hotspot-subhotspot-subcoldspot-coldspot distribution. (4) There is a differential spatial spillover effect of national urban infrastructure resilience, which is gradually strengthened under the role of the economy, financial development, population agglomeration and government funding and weakened under the role of urbanization, market consumption and infrastructure investment. By exploring the dynamic evolution of infrastructure resilience in cities at the prefecture level and above and its spatial spillover effects, we provide a scientific basis for avoiding the siphoning effect among cities, improving the level of infrastructure resilience, and guiding the construction and development of resilient cities.",We greatly appreciated Prof. Jingfeng Ge and Prof. Zhongjiang Feng for their valuable comments at various stages of this study.

The field of generative artificial intelligence and synthetic data is still early in its development, with a research gap evidencing that synthetic data can adequately be used to train algorithms that can be used on real data. This study compares the performance of a series machine learning models trained on real data and synthetic data, based on the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS).
METHODS: Features identified to be potentially of relevance by directed acyclic graphs were isolated from the NDNS dataset and used to construct synthetic datasets and impute missing data. Recursive feature elimination identified only four variables needed to predict mean arterial blood pressure: age, sex, weight and height. Bayesian generalised linear regression, random forest and neural network models were constructed based on these four variables to predict blood pressure. Models were trained on the real data training set (n = 2408), a synthetic data training set (n = 2408) and larger synthetic data training set (n = 4816) and a combination of the real and synthetic data training set (n = 4816). The same test set (n = 424) was used for each model.
RESULTS: Synthetic datasets demonstrated a high degree of fidelity with the real dataset. There was no significant difference between the performance of models trained on real, synthetic or combined datasets. Mean average error across all models and all training data ranged from 8.12 To 8.33. This indicates that synthetic data was capable of training equally accurate machine learning models as real data.

BACKGROUND: AF is a widespread heart disease affecting the well-being of patients and their family members physically and psychologically. Supporting patients and their family members could potentially facilitate regaining family strength and improve HRQoL.
METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed AF were randomised to standard care or additional family-focused intervention with change in global score of the Atrial Fibrillation Quality of Life Questionnaire (AFEQT) as primary outcome after six months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score, the European Heart Rhythm Association score, the Ice Expressive Family Functioning Questionnaire, and the Ice Family-Perceived Support Questionnaire (ICE-FPSQ).
RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients received standard care (n = 35) or family focused intervention (n = 33). The median change at the six-month follow-up on the global AFEQT score was 4.17 (-1.46-9.17) in the control group and 5.83 (-2.5-30) in the intervention group, yielding a median difference of -1.67 (p = 0.500). Change in ICE-FPSQ showed significant positive scores in favour of intervention (p < 0.001); other secondary outcome changes were non-significant.
CONCLUSION: The family-focused intervention had a small positive but non-significant effect on HRQoL compared to standard care. To address the impact of AF on the patients and family members seems to improve anxiety and depression scores and perceived family support.","The authors take this opportunity to express their gratitude to all patients and family members, to project nurses Marianne Nygaard Pedersen and Jennie Schier who delivered the family-focused intervention, to the nurses in the department who contributed with recruitment of patients and family members, and to the managers of the Department of Cardiology, Amager Hvidovre Hospital for supporting this study.","SR recieved funding for this study and the funders were; Aarhus University, Denmark; The Tryg Foundation (grant number 149913); and the Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre.

How to build an intelligence model to automatically classify the text information consulted by patients and recommend the correct department for patients is very important. In order to address the problem of insufficient feature extraction from Chinese medical text and low accuracy, this paper proposes a dual channel Chinese medical text classification model. The model extracts feature of Chinese medical text at different granularity, comprehensively and accurately obtains effective feature information, and finally recommends departments for patients according to text classification. One channel of the model focuses on medical nomenclatures, symptoms and other words related to hospital departments, gives different weights, calculates corresponding feature vectors with convolution kernels of different sizes, and then obtains local text representation. The other channel uses the BiGRU network and attention mechanism to obtain text representation, highlighting the important information of the whole sentence, that is, global text representation. Finally, the model uses full connection layer to combine the representation vectors of the two channels, and uses Softmax classifier for classification. The experimental results show that the accuracy, recall and F1-score of the model are improved by 10.65%, 8.94% and 11.62% respectively compared with the baseline models in average, which proves that our model has better performance and robustness.",The authors would like to thank the editor and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.,"This work was supported in part by the postdoctoral fund of FDCT, Macau (0003/2021/APD) and Key scientific research projects of universities in Henan province, China (23B520005).

However, few clinical trials have been conducted so far and no pharmacological treatment has yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic scoping review exploring the effectiveness and safety of atypical antipsychotics in anorexia nervosa (AN).
METHOD: We conducted a systematic scoping review of the effectiveness and tolerability of SGAs in the management of AN. We included articles published from January 1, 2000, through September 12, 2022 from the PubMed and PsycInfo databases and a complementary manual search. We selected articles about adolescents and adults treated for AN by four SGAs (risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole or olanzapine). This work complies with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for scoping reviews (PRIMA-ScR) and was registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository.
RESULTS: This review included 55 articles: 48 assessing the effectiveness of SGAs in AN and 7 focusing only on their tolerability and safety. Olanzapine is the treatment most frequently prescribed and studied with 7 randomized double-blind controlled trials. Other atypical antipsychotics have been evaluated much less often, such as aripiprazole (no randomized trials), quetiapine (two randomized controlled trials), and risperidone (one randomized controlled trial). These treatments are well tolerated with mild and transient adverse effects in this population at particular somatic risk.
DISCUSSION: Limitations prevent the studies both from reaching conclusive, reliable, robust, and reproducible results and from concluding whether or not SGAs are effective in anorexia nervosa. Nonetheless, they continue to be regularly prescribed in clinical practice. International guidelines suggest that olanzapine and aripiprazole can be interesting in severe or first-line resistant clinical situations.",We thank Jo Ann Cahn for the translation.,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Adult; Adolescent; Humans; Antipsychotic Agents; Olanzapine; Risperidone; Aripiprazole; Quetiapine Fumarate; Anorexia Nervosa; Benzodiazepines; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0278189,All OA; Gold,Article,"Thorey, Solène; Blanchet, Corinne; Guessoum, Sélim Benjamin; Moro, Marie Rose; Ludot, Maude; Carretier, Emilie","Thorey, Solène (APHP, Cochin Hospital, Maison de Solenn, Paris, France; Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University, Versailles, France); Blanchet, Corinne (APHP, Cochin Hospital, Maison de Solenn, Paris, France; UVSQ, Inserm, CESP, Team DevPsy, Paris-Saclay University, Villejuif, France); Guessoum, Sélim Benjamin (APHP, Cochin Hospital, Maison de Solenn, Paris, France; UVSQ, Inserm, CESP, Team DevPsy, Paris-Saclay University, Villejuif, France; Laboratoire de Psychologie Clinique, Psychopathologie et Psychanalyse, Paris Cité University, Boulogne-Billancourt, France); Moro, Marie Rose (APHP, Cochin Hospital, Maison de Solenn, Paris, France; UVSQ, Inserm, CESP, Team DevPsy, Paris-Saclay University, Villejuif, France; Laboratoire de Psychologie Clinique, Psychopathologie et Psychanalyse, Paris Cité University, Boulogne-Billancourt, France); Ludot, Maude (APHP, Cochin Hospital, Maison de Solenn, Paris, France; UVSQ, Inserm, CESP, Team DevPsy, Paris-Saclay University, Villejuif, France; Laboratoire de Psychologie Clinique, Psychopathologie et Psychanalyse, Paris Cité University, Boulogne-Billancourt, France); Carretier, Emilie (APHP, Cochin Hospital, Maison de Solenn, Paris, France; UVSQ, Inserm, CESP, Team DevPsy, Paris-Saclay University, Villejuif, France; Laboratoire de Psychologie Clinique, Psychopathologie et Psychanalyse, Paris Cité University, Boulogne-Billancourt, France)","Carretier, Emilie (Hôpital Cochin; Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health; )","Thorey, Solène (Hôpital Cochin; Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University); Blanchet, Corinne (Hôpital Cochin; Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health); Guessoum, Sélim Benjamin (Hôpital Cochin; Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health); Moro, Marie Rose (Hôpital Cochin; Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health); Ludot, Maude (Hôpital Cochin; Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health); Carretier, Emilie (Hôpital Cochin; Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0278189&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156250944,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,

The present study aimed to determine the incidence and mortality of type I and type II endometrial cancers (ECs), their overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between 2012 and 2016.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study used data from the Martinique Cancer Registry (MCR). 191 patients with corpus uterine cancer were extracted between 2012 and 2016. Patients with either endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC), uterine papillary serous carcinomas (UPSC), uterine clear cell carcinomas (UCCC) or uterine carcinosarcomas (UCS) were included. All other uterine cancers were excluded.
RESULTS: Among the 163 included patients, 97 (60%) were type I and 66 (40%) were type II. The standardized incidence rate is 4.50/100,000 for type I vs. 2.66/100,000 for type II. Three years DFS for all types, type I and type II was 81.5% [74.2-86.9], 84.9% [75.4-91] and 76.7% [63.8-85.5] respectively. The five-years OS for all types, type I and type II was 47.0% [38.9-54.7] vs. 58.8% [47.3-68.5] vs. 22.8% [15.0-37.7] respectively.

Using the panel data of HTI in 23 provinces (autonomous provinces and municipalities) in China from 2007 to 2016, this paper firstly calculates the Moran index of HTI's innovation performance (IP), and finds a spatial agglomeration effect. After rigorous testing, we determine the most suitable spatial metering model. Finally, the spatial effect is further decomposed into three kinds of effects: direct effect, indirect effect, and total effect. This paper studies the impact of foreign research and development (R&D) on IP of HTI and its spatial spillover effects. According to the research, foreign R&D has a significant role in promoting IP of HTI in China, and has specific spatial spillover effects. Significantly, foreign R&D has substantial positive spillover effects of space. When IP of HTI is measured by product innovation, there is no obvious space overflow. However, panel regression showed a significant positive effect. In terms of the influence on product IP of HTI, foreign R&D plays an almost equal role as local R&D. In terms of the impact on technological IP of HTI, foreign R&D input plays a positive role. It has a spatial spillover effect, the degree of impact is lower than that of domestic R&D input. Local governments should formulate relevant policies to encourage the fluidity of technical knowledge and overcome the sticky problem of foreign R&D technical knowledge, which is an essential aspect of absorbing foreign R&D technical knowledge in the future.",,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Industry; Inventions; Cities; China; Economic Development,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0282626,All OA; Gold,Article,"Han, Xiaohong; Feng, Hua","Han, Xiaohong (School of Economics and Management, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China); Feng, Hua (School of Economics and Management, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China)","Han, Xiaohong (Beijing Jiaotong University)","Han, Xiaohong (Beijing Jiaotong University); Feng, Hua (Beijing Jiaotong University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282626&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156250942,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics; 44 Human Society,

The present study aimed to examine whether Western mothers not only produced a greater amount of mental state talk, but also used a wider range of mental state terms (i.e., greater lexical variety) compared to Chinese mothers. We compared maternal mental state talk in 271 mother-child dyads from New Zealand, Australia and China, and coded both quantity (i.e., frequency) and quality (i.e., type, variety, valence) of mothers' mental state talk to their 2.5- to 5-year-olds. Western mothers produced more talk about cognitions and emotions, as well as modulations of assertions, but a similar amount of desire talk, compared to Chinese mothers, with the same patterns found in the variety of talk. Western mothers produced an overall higher amount of mental state talk and a greater variety of mental state terms, but crucially, still produced more MS talk after controlling for the variety. Neither the amount nor the variety of maternal MS talk was correlated with children's theory of mind. These findings shed light on the diverse ways that mothers construe and describe mental states in different cultures, and highlight the importance of examining different aspects of maternal mental state talk and their impact on children's theory of mind in future longitudinal studies.",We gratefully thank all participants who have contributed to this study.

Users' expectations, state of arousal and personality may also moderate the relationship between emotions and presence. An interoceptive predictive coding model of conscious presence (IPCM) considers presence as a product of the match between predictions of interoceptive emotional states and the actual states evoked by an experience (Seth et al. 2012). The present paper aims to test this model's applicability to VR for both high-arousal and low-arousal emotions. The moderating effect of personality traits on the creation of presence is also investigated. Results show that user expectations about emotional states in VR have an impact on presence, however, expression of this relationship is moderated by the intensity of an emotion, with only high-arousal emotions showing an effect. Additionally, users' personality traits moderated the relationship between emotions and presence. A refined model is proposed that predicts presence in VR by weighting emotions according to their level of arousal and by considering the impact of personality traits.",,"CJ’s research is partly funded by the European Union and Innovate UK (Project 101070533 — EMIL).

We show that specific activation patterns of the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) impact on individual performance during high-intensity cycling. In highly trained cyclists, we found a strong activation of the RF during hip flexion. This results in reduced negative force in the fourth quadrant of the pedal cycle. Furthermore, we discovered that pre-activation of the RF during hip flexion reduces force loss at the top dead center (TDC) and can improve force development during subsequent leg extension. Finally, we found that a higher performance level is associated with earlier and more intense coactivation of the RF and VL. This quadriceps femoris recruitment pattern improves force transmission and maintains propulsion at the TDC of the pedal cycle. Our results demonstrate neuromuscular adaptations in cycling that can be utilized to optimize training interventions in sports and rehabilitation.",We thank all athletes and the BA and MA students for their dedication and participation in this study.

The 9-item Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI-9) is a shortened version of the CSI-25, which is a patient-reported instrument used to screen people at risk of central sensitization (CS). The aim of this study was to cross-culturally adapt and validate a Chinese version of the CSI-9. The Chinese CSI-9 was generated by translation of the original English version, back-translation, cultural adaptation, and revision using the Delphi method. The Chinese CSI-9 was administered to 235 patients with chronic pain and 55 healthy controls. Structural validity (confirmatory factor analysis), construct validity (correlations with other scales), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC), and internal consistency (Cronbach's α) were evaluated. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed using one factor. The Chinese CSI-9 score was positively correlated with the Pain Catastrophic Scale (PCS) total score (r = 0.463), PCS subscale scores (r = 0.347-0.463), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) mean item score (r = 0.524), BPI total score (r = 0.773), and the number of painful sites (r = 0.451). The Chinese CSI-9 had excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.958) and excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.902 in the overall sample and 0.828 in the chronic pain population). The optimal cut-off value for the Chinese CSI-9 was 18 points. The Chinese CSI-9 had excellent test-retest reliability and satisfactory structural validity and construct validity.

This work presents the validation of a single-item measure of loneliness and its subjective experience: ""I am frequently alone/have few contacts"". It can be used in large-scale population surveys where an economical assessment is of key importance.
METHODS: Data was drawn from two representative German population surveys conducted in early and late 2020 (combined N = 4,984; 52.9% women; age: M = 48.39 years (SD = 17.88)). We determined the prevalence of loneliness in men and women across different age groups. In order to test concurrent validity, bivariate correlation analyses and Chi-square tests were performed. Convergent and discriminant validity were tested by investigating intercorrelations of the single-item measure of loneliness with another loneliness measure, other mental health outcomes, and associations with sociodemographic characteristics.
RESULTS: Based on the single-item measure, 23.4% of participants reported some degree of loneliness, 3.4% among them severe loneliness. Comparisons with the LS-S showed similar prevalence rates of loneliness. A moderately positive relationship between the two loneliness measures was found by bivariate correlation analysis (ρ = .57, p < .001), but results indicated only weak convergent validity. Construct validity was supported by associations with depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, satisfaction with life, household size, and partnership.
CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness is frequently reported in the general population.

This country is not included in the World Health Organization reports on poor quality products due to the lack of a qualified laboratory and monitoring system. Ensuring the quality of medicine is even more relevant in the case of diseases such as Tuberculosis, due to its high prevalence, complex treatment and continuous bacterial resistance. The aim was to develop a monitoring system to assess the quality of antituberculosis drugs products, by the substandard detection based on European and United States Pharmacopeial recommendations regarding quality control. In addition to studying the influence of accelerated storage conditions (40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% relative humidity) on their qualities and comparing the dissolution profiles to contrast the quality. 18 antituberculosis drug products were taken from Europe and Mauritania, and quality was studied through visual inspection and according to the compliance of the mass uniformity, uniformity of dosage units, dissolution, disintegration and friability pharmacopeial tests. Furthermore, a dissolution profile comparison was carried out to examine quality. A stability study was conducted to assess the influence of climatic conditions on the content and the dissolved amount of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, which were determined by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography system. As result, 69.3% of 13 Mauritanian formulations had a substandard quality mainly due to non-compliance with the test for friability or content uniformity of these medicines. All European drug products complied with pharmacopeia specifications. In addition, storage conditions affected the dissolution rate of ethambutol and the uniformity of the 4 antituberculosis combination drug products.","Authors wish to recognize Kane Elhadj Malick, from the Programme National de Lutte contre la Tuberculose et la Lèpre, and the Ministry of Health of Islamic Republic of Mauritania for their contribution.

Although this therapy may be a promising alternative treatment for refractory pituitary adenomas and pituitary carcinomas, the effects of anti-VEGF agents on the pituitary gland are not yet well understood. Here, we found that mice administered with OSI-930, an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases including VEGF receptor 1 and 2, frequently exhibited hemorrhage in the pituitary gland. This is the first report that anti-VEGF therapy can cause pituitary apoplexy. C57BL/6 mice were daily injected intraperitoneally with 100 mg/kg body weight of OSI-930 for one to six days. Pituitary glands were immunohistochemically examined. Four of six mice treated for three days and all of five mice treated for six days exhibited hemorrhage in the pituitary gland. In all cases, the hemorrhage occurred just around Rathke's cleft. In OSI-930-administered mice, the vascular coverage and branching were reduced in the anterior lobe, and capillary networks were also decreased in the intermediate lobe in a treatment-day dependent manner. Few blood vessels around Rathke's cleft of the intermediate lobe express VE-cadherin and are covered with platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β)-positive cells, which suggests that capillaries around Rathke's cleft of the intermediate lobe were VE-cadherin-negative and not covered with pericytes. The reduction of capillary plexus around Rathke's cleft was observed at the site where hemorrhage occurred, suggesting a causal relationship with the pathogenesis of pituitary hemorrhage. Our study demonstrates that anti-VEGF agents have a risk of pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary apoplexy should be kept in mind as an adverse effect of anti-VEGF therapy.",,"This work was partially supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (20K09360 to Masato Hojo), and by an institutional grant from Shiga Medical Center Research Institute (to Kenji Tanigaki).

The development of completely new drugs for such a novel disease is a challenging, time intensive process. Despite researchers around the world working on this task, no effective treatments have been developed yet. This emphasizes the importance of drug repurposing, where treatments are found among existing drugs that are meant for different diseases. A common approach to this is based on knowledge graphs, that condense relationships between entities like drugs, diseases and genes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) can then be used for the task at hand by predicting links in such knowledge graphs. Expanding on state-of-the-art GNN research, Doshi et al. recently developed the Dr-COVID model. We further extend their work using additional output interpretation strategies. The best aggregation strategy derives a top-100 ranking of 8,070 candidate drugs, 32 of which are currently being tested in COVID-19-related clinical trials. Moreover, we present an alternative application for the model, the generation of additional candidates based on a given pre-selection of drug candidates using collaborative filtering. In addition, we improved the implementation of the Dr-COVID model by significantly shortening the inference and pre-processing time by exploiting data-parallelism. As drug repurposing is a task that requires high computation and memory resources, we further accelerate the post-processing phase using a new emerging hardware-we propose a new approach to leverage the use of high-capacity Non-Volatile Memory for aggregate drug ranking.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Humans; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Drug Repositioning; Pandemics; Antiviral Agents,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0266572,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cohen, Sarel; Hershcovitch, Moshik; Taraz, Martin; Kißig, Otto; Issac, Davis; Wood, Andrew; Waddington, Daniel; Chin, Peter; Friedrich, Tobias","Cohen, Sarel (The Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yaffo, Tel Aviv-Yaffo, Israel); Hershcovitch, Moshik (IBM Research, Haif, Israel); Taraz, Martin (Hasso Plattner Institute, University Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany); Kißig, Otto (Hasso Plattner Institute, University Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany); Issac, Davis (Hasso Plattner Institute, University Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany); Wood, Andrew (Boston University, Boston, MA, United States of America); Waddington, Daniel (IBM Research, Almaden, CA, United States of America); Chin, Peter (Boston University, Boston, MA, United States of America); Friedrich, Tobias (Hasso Plattner Institute, University Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany)","Issac, Davis (Hasso Plattner Institute)","Cohen, Sarel (); Hershcovitch, Moshik (); Taraz, Martin (Hasso Plattner Institute); Kißig, Otto (Hasso Plattner Institute); Issac, Davis (Hasso Plattner Institute); Wood, Andrew (Boston University); Waddington, Daniel (IBM Research - Thomas J.

The karst region in Xiangxi, Hunan province, China was selected as the study site. Here, we determined soil physical and chemical differences in soil profiles of karst areas with ecological restoration activities. The results showed that (1) the soil properties showed a significant difference between the restoration vegetation and uncultivated land, especially in soil physical properties. The soil moisture conversion coefficient (83.0%) and soil bulk density (1.37g/cm3) of Liriodendron chinense (Hemsl.) Sarg reached the highest value among 12 vegetations. 2) The topsoil was more sensitive to ecological restoration. Soil physical properties in the topsoil samples from the forest management areas were significantly higher than uncultivated lands (P < 0.05). (3) Redundancy analysis showed that the soil chemical content differed significantly among the types of forest vegetation restoration and different soil layers. Among the nutrients analysis, Mg, Zn and K were the main factors affecting soil properties in the rocky desertification areas. Therefore, our results recommend planting the broadleaved deciduous forest as the preferred forest among three different forest types to enhance soil fertility and water conservation functions, especially in subtropical karst areas ecosystems, which provided for making scientific forest restoration management in the karst region.","The authors should thank the National long-term scientific research base for the comprehensive control of rocky desertification in Wuling Mountain of Jishou City, Hunan province and Research Institute of Tropical Forestry, CAF for their supporting the fieldwork and thank for Guangyi Zhou for their assistance in measuring the soil physical and chemical properties.","The following grant information was disclosed by the authors: Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund: CAFYBB2019SZ003 and Hunan Province Forestry Science and Technology Research and Innovation Project: XLKY2023-30.

Knowledge is limited and histological heterogeneity adds complexity to the rarity. There is a wide consensus that to support clinical research on rare cancer, clinical registries should be developed within networks specializing in rare cancers. In the EU, a unique opportunity is provided by the European Reference Networks (ERN). The ERN EURACAN is dedicated to rare adults solid cancers, here we present the protocol of the EURACAN registry on rare head and neck cancers (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05483374).
STUDY DESIGN: Registry-based cohort study including only people with rare head and neck cancers.
OBJECTIVES: to help describe the natural history of rare head and neck cancers;to evaluate factors that influence prognosis;to assess treatment effectiveness;to measure indicators of quality of care.
METHODS: Settings and participants It is an hospital based registry established in hospitals with expertise in head and neck cancers. Only adult patients with epithelial tumours of nasopharynx; nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses; salivary gland cancer in large and small salivary glands; and middle ear will be included in the registry. This registry won't select a sample of patients. Each patient in the facility who meets the above mentioned inclusion criteria will be followed prospectively and longitudinally with follow-up at cancer progression and / or cancer relapse or patient death. It is a secondary use of data which will be collected from the clinical records. The data collected for the registry will not entail further examinations or admissions to the facility and/or additional appointments to those normally provided for the patient follow-up. Variables Data will be collected on patient characteristics (eg. patient demographics, lifestyle, medical history, health status); exposure data (eg. disease, procedures, treatments of interest) and outcomes (e.g. survival, progression, progression-free survival, etc.). In addition, data on potential confounders (e.g. comorbidity; functional status etc.) will be also collected. Statistical methods The data analyses will include descriptive statistics showing patterns of patients' and cancers' variables and indicators describing the quality of care. Multivariable Cox's proportional hazards model and Hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause or cause specific mortality will be used to determine independent predictors of overall survival, recurrence etc. Variables to include in the multivariable regression model will be selected based on the results of univariable analysis. The role of confounding or effect modifiers will be evaluated using stratified analysis or sensitivity analysis. To assess treatment effectiveness, multivariable models with propensity score adjustment and progression-free survival will be performed. Adequate statistical (eg. marginal structural model) methods will be used if time-varying treatments/confounders and confounding by indication (selective prescribing) will be present.
RESULTS: The registry initiated recruiting in May 2022. The estimated completion date is December 2030 upon agreement on the achievement of all the registry objectives. As of October 2022, the registry is recruiting. There will be a risk of limited representativeness due to the hospital-based nature of the registry and to the fact that hospital contributing to the registry are expert centres for these rare cancers. Clinical Follow-up could also be an issue but active search of the life status of the patients will be guaranteed.",We thank Giulia del Monego for her technical assistance.,"This work was supported by European Union’s Health Programme (2014–2020).

In general, long-term measurement of fetal heart rate is the most widely used method of providing information about fetal health. In addition to fetal life, growth, and maturity, information such as congenital heart disease, often due to structural or functional defects in heart structure that often occur during the first trimester of pregnancy during fetal development, can be detected by continuous monitoring of fetal heart rate. The gold standard for monitoring the fetus's health is the use of non-invasive methods and portable devices so that while maintaining the health of the mother and fetus, it provides the possibility of continuous monitoring, especially for mothers who have a high-risk pregnancy. Therefore, the present study aimed to propose a low-cost, compact, and portable device for recording the heart rate of 18-day-old fetal mouse heart cells. Introduced device allows non-invasive heart rate monitoring instantly and without side effects for mouse fetal heart cells. One-dimensional gold-plated plasmonic specimens as a physiological signal recorder are mainly chips with nanoarray of resonant nanowire patterns perform in an integrated platform. Here the surface plasmon waves generated in a one-dimensional plasmonic sample are paired with an electrical wave from the heart pulse, and this two-wave pairing is used to record and detect the heart rate of fetal heart cells with high accuracy and good sensitivity. This measurement was performed in normal mode and two different stimulation modes. Stimulation of cells was performed once using adrenaline and again with electrical stimulation. Our results show that our sensor is sensitive enough to detect heart rate in both standard and excitatory states and is also well able to detect and distinguish between changes in heart rate caused by different excitatory conditions.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,"Pregnancy; Female; Humans; Animals; Mice; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Heart Defects, Congenital; Fetal Development; Fetal Heart; Prenatal Care",2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,18,3,e0282863,All OA; Gold,Article,"Akbari, S.; Hamidi, S.

Objectives
Response shift refers to variations in self-reported evaluations at different times from changes in one’s internal standards, values, and meanings. The current study explored the utility of the then-test to detect a potential mindfulness-based response shift occurrence during a mindfulness- and yoga-based intervention for student musicians, and to ascertain to what extent effect sizes could differ when adjusting for it.MethodParticipants (n = 31) completed the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) halfway through the intervention (Time 1-FFMQ), post-intervention (Time 2-FFMQ), and immediately after Time 2-FFMQ with a then-test approach that asked participants to rate the FFMQ based on retrospective reflections on their mindfulness at Time 1 (then-test-FFMQ). Paired t-tests and Hedges’ g effect sizes were computed to estimate three potential effects: response shift (Time 1-FFMQ minus then-test-FFMQ), the conventional intervention effect (Time 2-FFMQ minus Time 1-FFMQ), and the effect after adjusting for response shift (i.e., actual intervention effect = Time 2-FFMQ minus then-test-FFMQ).ResultsResponse shift was significant for the FFMQ Observe subscale (g = 0.41) and total scale (g = 0.37). The adjusted scores in all subscales (Observe, g = 0.47; Describe, g = 0.25; Act Aware, g = 0.40; Non-judge, g = 0.28; Non-react, g = 0.57) and total scale (g = 0.60) achieved significance and yielded larger effect sizes than the conventional results, for which only Act Aware (g = 0.28), Non-react (g = 0.36), and total scale (g = 0.28) were significant.ConclusionsNotwithstanding some methodological limitations, this study lends support to the utility of the then-test to quantify response shift. When adjusting for it, effect sizes from a mindfulness- and yoga-based intervention were generally amplified.PreregistrationThis study was not preregistered.","We thank the Royal Conservatory of Music Victoria Eugenia, Granada, and especially the board of directors, faculty, and students for supporting this investigation.

Interactive learning resources provide students with the opportunity to engage with content in a more personalised manner. H5P (HTML 5 Package) is a collaborative platform that allows developers to create interactive content and has been regularly used in education settings. Some evidence suggests using interactive H5P resources in online education courses could lead to greater student engagement. However, to date, there has been little investigation into whether H5P resources can improve student learning outcomes. The current study aimed to assess whether using interactive H5P resources improved assessed learning outcomes in an online undergraduate psychology course. A randomized cross-over design was utilized to test whether students exposed to H5P interactive videos had improved assessment results when compared to a control group. This study found no meaningful differences in assessment scores between students exposed to H5P versus those that were not. There was low overall engagement with the interactive content. However, students who did engage with the resources reported a positive experience and indicated a preference for more interactive elements in future courses. Future research should extend on the instructional design obstacles identified in this study, for example, by examining whether improved accessibility and education on the benefits of interactive resources would increase engagement and grades.","The authors would like to thank Dr John Mingoia, Dr Vitomir Kovanović, and Dr Srecko Joksimovic for their assistance with data collection.

While some seized the opportunity to learn and innovate, others experienced difficulties. This study provides insights into the differences between university teachers during the COVID-19 crisis. A survey among university teachers (N = 283) was conducted to investigate their attitudes towards online teaching, beliefs about students’ learning, level of stress experienced, self-efficacy and beliefs about their own professional development. Employing a hierarchical cluster analysis, four distinct teacher profiles were found. Profile 1 was critical but eager; Profile 2 was positive but stressed; Profile 3 was critical and reluctant; Profile 4 was optimistic and easy-going. The profiles differed significantly in their use and perception of support. We suggest that teacher education research should carefully consider sampling procedures or take a person-centred research approach and that universities should develop targeted forms of teacher communication, support and policy.",,,Learning Environments Research,,,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,,,1-26,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Stevens, T.

It uses a geographically and temporally weighted regression model for conducting an empirical study on the effects of R&D investment and network penetration on human development in each province (municipality) of China. There is significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the impact of R&D investment and network penetration on human development across provinces (municipalities) in China due to differences in resource endowments and economic and social development. For R&D investment, eastern provinces (municipalities) have mostly positive effects on human development, and central regions have mostly weak positive or negative effects. In contrast, western provinces (municipalities) show different development paths, with weak positive effects in the early stage and significant positive effects after 2010. Most provinces (municipalities) show a continuous and increasing positive effect for network penetration. The marginal contributions of this paper are mainly in improving the shortcomings in research perspectives, empirical methods, and research data in the study of human development influencing factors in China relative to the study of HDI itself in terms of measurement or application dimensions. This paper constructs a human development index for China, analyzes its spatial and temporal distribution, and explores the impact of R&D investment and network penetration on human development in China, with the hope of providing lessons for China and developing countries to promote the level of human development and cope with the pandemic.",The authors are grateful to the two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on our analyses and prior version of the manuscript and thankfully acknowledge the financial support from The National Social Science Fund of China under Grant No. 17BTJ006.,,Social Indicators Research,,,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,,,,1-25,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Qin, Zhilong; Zhang, Hongli; Zhao, Bin","Qin, Zhilong (School of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, Peking University, 100871, Beijing, China); Zhang, Hongli (School of Statistics, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, 611130, Chengdu, China; NO. 555 of Liutai Road, Wenjiang District, 611130, Chengdu, Sichuan, China); Zhao, Bin (Department of Statistics, North Dakota State University, 58105, Fargo, ND, USA)","Zhang, Hongli (Southwestern University of Finance and Economics; )","Qin, Zhilong (Peking University); Zhang, Hongli (Southwestern University of Finance and Economics); Zhao, Bin (North Dakota State University)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11205-023-03091-z.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156250579,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies",

We identify-three distinct response patterns, which we name the 'Agnostic', the 'Pragmatic' and the 'Sceptic', and show how the interplay of the salient social identity, personal privacy norms, and the privacy calculus guides the dynamic of privacy decision-making in light of experiential feedback, and the developing public discourse about security risks. We provide empirical evidence for multilevel decision-making and highlight the contextual and social nature of privacy decision-making about platform mode of use for remote work.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Business Research,,,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,2023-06,161,,113772,All OA; Green,Article,"Dassel, Katharina Sophie; Klein, Stefan","Dassel, Katharina Sophie (School of Business and Economics, University of Münster, Münster.); Klein, Stefan (School of Business and Economics, University of Münster, Münster.)","Klein, Stefan (University of Münster)","Dassel, Katharina Sophie (University of Münster); Klein, Stefan (University of Münster)",1,1,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10018285,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156250535,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services",

Given the differential health impacts of alcoholic beverage type, it is important to understand the drivers of these trends. We investigated: (a) temporal trends in beverage preference and (b) the effects of age, period and cohort on these trends.
METHODS: Data came from nine waves (1995-2018; ntotal = 75,550) of the German Epidemiological Survey of Substance Abuse, a nationally representative household survey of individuals aged 18-59 years. The quantity of beer, wine, spirits and mixed drinks drank in the last 30 days was transformed into grammes of ethanol, and the beverage type preference was estimated as the proportion of total ethanol consumption. Fractional multinomial logit regression was applied to analyse the age, period and cohort effects on temporal trends of beverage preference by sex.
RESULTS: The preference for spirits and mixed drinks decreased with increasing age, while the preference for wine increased with no age effect on beer. There was a general decrease in the preference for beer and an increase in the preference for wine among both sexes, with an additional increase in the preference for spirits in males.
CONCLUSION: Trends in beverage preference were more related to individual ageing and changes in the whole population than to cohorts. With the continued reduction in alcohol consumption, the decreasing preference for beer and the growing preference for wine suggest a positive development. Trends of an increasing preference for spirits in males are of concern.",,,Alcohol and Alcoholism,,,2023-03-16,2023,2023-03-16,2023-03-16,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Wilms, Nicolas; Seitz, Nicki-Nils; Schwarzkopf, Larissa; Olderbak, Sally; Kraus, Ludwig","Wilms, Nicolas (IFT Institut für Therapieforschung, Munich 80804, Germany.); Seitz, Nicki-Nils (IFT Institut für Therapieforschung, Munich 80804, Germany.); Schwarzkopf, Larissa (IFT Institut für Therapieforschung, Munich 80804, Germany.); Olderbak, Sally (IFT Institut für Therapieforschung, Munich 80804, Germany.; Psychology Department, College of Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.); Kraus, Ludwig (IFT Institut für Therapieforschung, Munich 80804, Germany.; Institute of Psychology, ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest 1075, Hungary.; Department of Public Health Sciences, Centre for Social Research on Alcohol and Drugs, Stockholm University, Stockholm 10691, Sweden.)",,"Wilms, Nicolas (IFT Institut für Therapieforschung); Seitz, Nicki-Nils (IFT Institut für Therapieforschung); Schwarzkopf, Larissa (IFT Institut für Therapieforschung); Olderbak, Sally (IFT Institut für Therapieforschung; University of Arizona); Kraus, Ludwig (IFT Institut für Therapieforschung; Eötvös Loránd University; Stockholm University)",0,0,,,https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/alcalc/agad013/49550242/agad013.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156223858,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

As Malaysia begins its transition into the endemic phase, it is essential to identify the key determinants of COVID-19 vaccination intention amongst the pockets of the population who are still hesitant. Therefore, focusing on a sample of individuals who did not register for the COVID-19 vaccination, the current study integrated two widely used frameworks in the public health domain-the health belief model (HBM) and the theory of reasoned action (TRA)-to examine the inter-relationships of the predictors of vaccination intention amongst these individuals.
METHODOLOGY: Primary data from 117 respondents who did not register for the COVID-19 vaccination were collected using self-administered questionnaires to capture predictors of vaccination intention amongst individuals in a Malaysian context. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique was used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: Subjective norms and attitude play key mediating roles between the HBM factors and vaccination intention amongst the unregistered respondents. In particular, subjective norms mediate the relationship between cues to action and vaccination intention, highlighting the significance of important others to influence unregistered individuals who are already exposed to information from mass media and interpersonal discussions regarding vaccines. Trust, perceived susceptibility, and perceived benefits indirectly influence vaccination intention through attitude, indicating that one's attitude is vital in promoting behavioral change.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that the behavioral factors could help understand the reasons for vaccine refusal or acceptance, and shape and improve health interventions, particularly among the vaccine-hesitant group in a developing country. Therefore, policymakers and key stakeholders can develop effective strategies or interventions to encourage vaccination amongst the unvaccinated for future health pandemics by targeting subjective norms and attitude.",The authors thank Ipsos Malaysia for assisting in the data collection via their online portal.,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Humans; COVID-19 Vaccines; Malaysia; COVID-19; Vaccination Hesitancy; Intention; Vaccination,2023-03-15,2023,2023-03-15,,18,3,e0282520,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vaithilingam, Santha; Hwang, Li-Ann; Nair, Mahendhiran; Ng, Jason Wei Jian; Ahmed, Pervaiz; Musa, Kamarul Imran","Vaithilingam, Santha (Sunway Institute for Global Strategy and Competitiveness, Sunway University, Selangor, Malaysia); Hwang, Li-Ann (Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics, School of Business, Monash University, Selangor, Malaysia); Nair, Mahendhiran (Sunway Institute for Global Strategy and Competitiveness, Sunway University, Selangor, Malaysia); Ng, Jason Wei Jian (Department of Pure and Applied Mathematics, School of Mathematical Sciences, Sunway University, Selangor, Malaysia); Ahmed, Pervaiz (Sunway Institute for Global Strategy and Competitiveness, Sunway University, Selangor, Malaysia); Musa, Kamarul Imran (Department of Community Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kelantan, Malaysia)","Hwang, Li-Ann (Monash University Malaysia)","Vaithilingam, Santha (Sunway University); Hwang, Li-Ann (Monash University Malaysia); Nair, Mahendhiran (Sunway University); Ng, Jason Wei Jian (Sunway University); Ahmed, Pervaiz (Sunway University); Musa, Kamarul Imran (Universiti Sains Malaysia)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282520&type=printable,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156210375,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context",3 Good Health and Well Being

However, information is scarce about the impact of nasal resistance assessed by rhinomanometry on CPAP therapy. This study aimed to examine the relationship between CPAP adherence and nasal resistance evaluated by rhinomanometry, and to identify clinical findings that can affect adherence to CPAP therapy for patients with OSA. This study included 260 patients (199 men, 61 women; age 58 [interquartile ranges (IQR) 50-66] years) with a new diagnosis of OSA who underwent rhinomanometry (before, and 1 and 3 months after CPAP introduction) between January 2011 and December 2018. CPAP use was recorded, and the good and poor CPAP adherence groups at the time of patient registration were compared. Furthermore, those with improved and unimproved pre-CPAP high rhinomanometry values were also compared. Their apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) by polysomnography at diagnosis was 45.6 (IQR 33.7-61.6)/hour, but the residual respiratory event (estimated AHI) at enrollment was 2.5 (IQR 1.4-3.9)/hour and the usage time was 318 (IQR 226-397) minutes, indicating that CPAP was effective and adherence was good. CPAP adherence was negatively correlated with nasal resistance (r = -0.188, p = 0.002). The participants were divided into good (n = 153) and poor (n = 107) CPAP adherence groups. In the poor adherence group, rhinomanometry values before CPAP introduction were worse (inspiration, p = 0.003; expiration, p = 0.006). There was no significant difference in patient background when comparing those with improved (n = 16) and unimproved (n = 12) pre-CPAP high rhinomanometry values. However, CPAP usage time was significantly longer in the improved group 1 month (p = 0.002) and 3 months (p = 0.026) after CPAP introduction. The results suggest that nasal resistance evaluated by rhinomanometry is a useful predictor of CPAP adherence, and that improved rhinomanometry values may contribute to extending the duration of CPAP use.",The authors would like to thank Tazuko Kikuya (Niigata University) for her assistance in acquiring and collecting data for this study.

Most cases are sporadic, but some patients report a positive family history. Identifying functionally important gene variants associated with this disease has the potential to uncover the molecular basis of cholesteatoma pathology with implications for disease prevention, surveillance, or management. We performed an observational WES study of 21 individuals treated for cholesteatoma who were recruited from ten multiply affected families. These family studies were complemented with gene-level mutational burden analysis. We also applied functional enrichment analyses to identify shared properties and pathways for candidate genes and their products. Filtered data collected from pairs and trios of participants within the ten families revealed 398 rare, loss of function (LOF) variants co-segregating with cholesteatoma in 389 genes. We identified six genes DENND2C, DNAH7, NBEAL1, NEB, PRRC2C, and SHC2, for which we found LOF variants in two or more families. The parallel gene-level analysis of mutation burden identified a significant mutation burden for the genes in the DNAH gene family, which encode products involved in ciliary structure. Functional enrichment analyses identified common pathways for the candidate genes which included GTPase regulator activity, calcium ion binding, and degradation of the extracellular matrix. The number of candidate genes identified and the locus heterogeneity that we describe within and between multiply affected families suggest that the genetic architecture for familial cholesteatoma is complex.","We are grateful to the family members who consented to participate in the study.

The current study investigated whether there are psychological costs of feeling subordinate to friends by examining longitudinal associations between adolescents’ perceived friend dominance and internalizing symptoms. Across one year, five waves of survey data were collected from 388 adolescents (Mage = 14.05, SDage = 0.41; 61% female; 46% White, 19% Black, 17% Asian, 6% Arab, Middle Eastern, North African, 6% Biracial/Multiethnic, 3% Latinx/Hispanic, 1% American Indian/Native American, 1% identifying with another race/ethnicity, <1% not reporting). Multilevel modeling disentangled between- and within-person effects of perceived friend dominance on depressive and anxiety (internalizing) symptoms and tested self-esteem as a mediator. The results indicated that both individual differences and intraindividual fluctuations in perceived friend dominance were associated with internalizing symptoms. At the between-person level, adolescents who perceived their friends as more dominant reported more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms than adolescents who perceived their friends as less dominant. At the within-person level, increases in perceived friend dominance were accompanied by increases in depressive and anxiety symptoms, and these associations were partially explained by changes in self-esteem. The findings advance understanding of power dynamics in adolescents’ close friendships and highlight the psychological toll of feeling dominated by friends.","We thank the adolescents and schools that participated in this research.

Insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R) and the Insulin receptor (IR) are associated with poor outcomes in TNBC. Targeting IGF1R has failed clinically. We aimed to test if inhibiting both IR/IGF1R was a rationale therapeutic approach to treat TNBC. We showed that despite IGF1R and IR being expressed in TNBC, their expression is not associated with a negative survival outcome. Furthermore, targeting both IR/IGF1R with inhibitors in multiple TNBC cell lines did not inhibit cell growth. Linsitinib, a small molecule inhibitor of both IGF1R and IR, did not block tumour formation and had no effect on tumour growth in vivo. Cumulatively these data suggest that while IGF1R and IR are expressed in TNBC, they are not good therapeutic targets. A potential reason for the limited anti-cancer impact when IR/IGF1R was targeted may be because multiple signalling pathways are altered in TNBC. Therefore, targeting individual signalling pathways may not be sufficient to inhibit cancer growth.","We would like to acknowledge Boehringer Ingelheim, who kindly gave us access to xentuzumab which was used in our studies.","This research was supported by funding from Breast Cancer Now Starter Grant (2014NovSP452) the Health Research Board (CSA/2007/11), Science Foundation Ireland (08/SRC/B1410), the Cancer Clinical Research Trust/The Caroline Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society Collaborative Cancer Research Centre Breast-Predict (CCRC13GAL).

There is limited research within the MS sport setting, particularly related to sport-related injury prevention. This qualitative study aimed to better understand the sport culture within MS sports and the communication strategies used among invested groups (i.e., athletes, parents, staff inclusive of coaches and school nurses). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 athletes, 20 parents, and 18 staff (e.g., coaches, school nurses) from seven MS in two school districts during the 2018/19 and 2019/20 school years. Topics focused on understanding school- and sport-related factors related to education, safety, and communication. Analysis used a consensual qualitative research tradition, in which the research team discussed individually developed themes and categories from transcribed interviews, with the goal of coming to a consensus and creating a codebook. Throughout the coding process, the research team would reconvene to discuss coding decisions until consensus was reached. This study focuses on the themes of sport culture and communication. Dominant categories identified within sport culture related to participants noting why they were interested in MS sports, and their struggles with their perceived roles and engagement (e.g., helping parents stay engaged, finding coaches, oversight of school nurses). Competitiveness and safety could have conflicting roles and priority. Dominant categories identified within communication centered around limited communication between coaches and parents. Technological assistance (e.g., phone apps, websites) was available, but often varied by school and sport. Concussions were seldom discussed unless during the preseason meeting or when one occurred. Findings highlight that the MS sport settings may struggle with incorporating primary prevention into their cultures and ensuring reliable communication among individuals.

However, its efficacy in healthy adults is ambiguous. It was reported that concentrations of terpene lactones, active components of GBE that are present in very low concentrations in the brain, were significantly increased following administration of a mixture of GBE, sesame seed, and turmeric (GBE/MST) in mice. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of GBE/MST on the cognitive function of healthy adults by comparing it with that of GBE alone.
METHODS: Altogether, 159 participants providing informed consent will be recruited from a population of healthy adults aged 20-64 years. Normal cognitive function at baseline will be confirmed using the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment battery. Participants will be randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to the GBE/MST, GBE, and placebo groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. The Wechsler Memory Scale, Trail Making Test, and Stroop Color and Word Test will be used to assess the memory and executive functions at baseline and at the endpoint (24 weeks). For biological assessment, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) will be performed simultaneously with the neuropsychological tests.
DISCUSSION: This study aims to obtain data that can help compare the profile changes in memory and executive functions among participants consuming GBE/MST, GBE alone, and placebo for 24 weeks. Alterations in the default mode network will be evaluated by comparing the rs-fMRI findings between baseline and 24 weeks in the aforementioned groups. Our results may clarify the impact of GBE on cognitive function and the functional mechanism behind altered cognitive function induced by GBE components.

This highly influential model has resulted in the development of numerous psychometric instruments that measure addictive behaviors according to these criteria. However, recent research suggests that, in the context of behavioral addictions, certain components constitute peripheral features that do not distinguish non-pathological from pathological behavior. Using ""addictive"" use of social media as a representative example, we examined this perspective by testing whether these six components actually assess central features of addiction, or whether some of them constitute peripheral features that are not indicative of a disorder. Four independent samples totaling 4,256 participants from the general population completed the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, a six-item psychometric instrument derived from the components model of addiction to assess social media ""addiction"". By performing structural equation modeling and network analyses, we showed that the six components did not form a unitary construct and, crucially, that some components (i.e., salience, tolerance) were not associated with measures assessing psychopathological symptoms. Taken together, these results suggest that psychometric instruments based on the components model conflate central and peripheral features of addiction when applied to behavioral addictions. This implies that such instruments pathologize involvement in appetitive behaviors. Our findings thus call for renewing the conceptualization and assessment of behavioral addictions.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Studies have found social isolation and loneliness to be strongly associated with anxiety and depression, which have been associated with increased smoking and vaping rates among young adults, including college students.Objectives: To examine relationships between psychological distress and nicotine use within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: A cross-sectional online survey (n = 4634; 77.9% female) was used to collect nicotine use and psychological measures from students enrolled at a large Midwestern university. Timeline follow-back data were collected from students reporting current cigarette or electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use in the week before and immediately following the closure of campus due to the pandemic. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the interaction between nicotine use and psychological symptoms across the 2-week period.Results: Both cigarette (Rate ratio (RR) = 1.115, 95% CI = 1.061, 1.171, p < .0001) and e-cigarette (β = 0.258, 95% CI = 0.166, 0.351, p < .0001) use increased significantly following campus closure. Students experiencing higher levels of depression reported greater increases in e-cigarette use frequency over time as compared to students reporting fewer symptoms of depression (β = 0.018, 95% CI = 0.006, 0.030, p = .004).Conclusions: Increases in nicotine use were found immediately following the implementation of public health safety measures that closed most university campuses.

Life expectancy in Brazil is compromised by the high risk of death from male and female homicides, a growing social problem. This study aimed to integrate different public datasets and describe the sociodemographic, criminal, and medicolegal characteristics of the homicides of girls and women occurring in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil, from 2010 to 2016. The data were obtained from autopsy reports, police reports, and records from crime scenes. During this period, there was a significant increase in overall standardized rates of female homicides (4.98 to 10.85), with a pronounced increase in non-gender-related deaths, especially due to urban violence, such as involvement in drug trafficking and other crimes and robbery resulting in death. Young (15-29 years of age), non-White women were the most affected. Increased female homicide rates due to non-gender-related factors is a new and worrying phenomenon in Brazil.

U.S. adults hold misperceptions about nicotine harm. However, little is known about youth nicotine perceptions.
AIMS AND METHODS: To address this gap, we assessed U.S. youths' nicotine perceptions and how these perceptions relate to tobacco use. Participants were youth (ages 12-17) in waves 4 (w4; December 2016-January 2018; N = 14 798) and 4.5 (w4.5; December 2017-December 2018; N = 12 918) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, a nationally representative longitudinal cohort study. We describe beliefs about nicotine; perceptions of the nicotine harm in cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT); and demographic differences. Regressions assess whether w4 nicotine perceptions predicted w4.5 tobacco use.
RESULTS: Most youth correctly responded that nicotine is the main cause of addiction (77.1%) but incorrectly responded that nicotine is the main substance that causes smoking-related cancer (74.7%). Youth distinguished between the harm of nicotine in different products, and on average rated the nicotine in cigarettes as most harmful, followed by e-cigarettes and NRT. Among youth who did not use at w4, greater harm perceptions of nicotine in cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and NRT were associated with lower likelihood of reporting current tobacco use at w4.5. Among youth who currently used cigarettes or e-cigarettes at wave 4, nicotine perceptions did not predict switching to e-cigarettes or cigarettes, respectively, at wave 4.5.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the challenge of developing effective and comprehensive communication strategies that accurately convey the effects of nicotine without encouraging tobacco use.
IMPLICATIONS: Many U.S. adults have misperceptions about nicotine, incorrectly believing it is the substance that causes most smoking-related cancers; studies have not assessed youth's perceptions of nicotine and how these perceptions relate to tobacco use. This study found that similar to adults, most youth incorrectly believed nicotine is the main substance that causes smoking-related cancer; youth also distinguish between the harmfulness of nicotine in different products, and rated the nicotine in cigarettes as most harmful, followed by e-cigarettes and NRT. Perceptions of the harm in different nicotine and tobacco products negatively predicted becoming a person who used tobacco a year later, but did not predict switching between e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Findings highlight the challenges of accurately communicating about the harms of nicotine without encouraging tobacco use; findings can be considered in the context of FDA's potential nicotine product standard that would lower nicotine levels in combustible tobacco products to a minimally or nonaddictive level.",,,Nicotine & Tobacco Research,,,2023-03-15,2023,2023-03-15,2023-03-15,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"O'Brien, Erin Keely; Roditis, Maria; Persoskie, Alexander; Margolis, Katherine A","O'Brien, Erin Keely (Center for Tobacco Products, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.); Roditis, Maria (Center for Tobacco Products, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.); Persoskie, Alexander (Center for Tobacco Products, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.); Margolis, Katherine A (Center for Tobacco Products, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.)",,"O'Brien, Erin Keely (United States Food and Drug Administration); Roditis, Maria (United States Food and Drug Administration); Persoskie, Alexander (United States Food and Drug Administration); Margolis, Katherine A (United States Food and Drug Administration)",0,0,,,https://academic.oup.com/ntr/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/ntr/ntad028/49533265/ntad028.pdf,https://erih.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156217251,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

To address this gap, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed Basic Emergency Care (BEC): Approach to the acutely ill and injured, a multi-day, open-source course for healthcare workers in low-resource settings. Building on the BEC foundation, this study uses an implementation science (IS) lens to develop, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive emergency care curriculum in a single emergency facility in Liberia.
METHODS: A six-month emergency care curriculum consisting of BEC content, standardized WHO clinical documentation forms, African Federation of Emergency Medicine (AFEM) didactics, and clinical mentorship by visiting emergency medicine (EM) faculty was designed and implemented using IS frameworks at Redemption Hospital, a low-resource public referral hospital in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. Healthcare worker performance on validated knowledge-based exams during pre- and post-intervention testing, post-course surveys, and patient outcomes were used to evaluate the program.
RESULTS: Nine visiting EM physicians provided 1400 hours of clinical mentorship and 560 hours of didactic training to fifty-six Redemption Hospital staff over six-months. Median test scores improved 20.0% (p<0.001) among the forty-three healthcare workers who took both the pre- and post-intervention tests. Participants reported increased confidence in caring for medical and trauma patients and comfort performing emergency care tasks on post-course surveys. Emergency unit (EU)/Isolation unit (IU) mortality decreased during the six-month implementation period, albeit non-significantly. Course satisfaction was high across multiple domains.
DISCUSSION: This study builds on prior research supporting WHO efforts to improve emergency care globally. BEC implementation over a six-month timeframe using IS principles is an effective alternative strategy for facilities in resource-constrained environments wishing to strengthen emergency care delivery.",We would like to thank the Redemption Hospital administration and staff for their role in the development of this program and engagement throughout the course.

Often, individual patients benefit only from some SGAs and not others. The mechanisms underlying this unpredictability in treatment efficacy remain unclear. All SGAs bind the D3 dopamine receptor (D3R) and are traditionally considered antagonists for dopamine receptor signaling.
METHODS: Here, we use a combination of two photon calcium imaging, in vitro signaling assays, and mouse behavior to assess signaling by SGAs at the D3R.
RESULTS: We report that some clinically important SGAs function as arrestin-3-agonists at D3R, resulting in modulation of calcium channels localized to the site of action potential initiation in prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons. We further show that chronic treatment with an arrestin-3-agonist-SGA, but not an antagonist-SGA, abolishes D3R function through post-endocytic receptor degradation by G-protein coupled receptor-associated sorting protein-1 (GASP1).
CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate D3R-arrestin-3 signaling as a source of SGA variability, highlighting the importance of including arrestin-3 signaling in characterizations of drug action. Furthermore, they suggest that post-endocytic receptor trafficking that occurs during chronic SGA treatment may contribute to treatment efficacy.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank Dr. Michael Roberts for help with image analysis, Dr. Matthew McGregor and Anna Lipkin for assistance with data analysis, Anirudh Gaur for guidance on in vitro experiments, Dr. Robert Lefkowitz for the arrestin-3 KO mice, Chenyu Wang and Henry Kyoung for assistance with IP injections, and members of the Bender and Whistler labs for critically assessing this work.

Here we present updated findings from our systematic review and meta-analysis on the mental health impacts among hospital healthcare workers during COVID-19.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase and Web Of Science Core Collection between 1st January 2000 to 17th February 2022 for studies using validated methods and reporting on the prevalence of diagnosed or probable mental health disorders in hospital healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. A meta-analysis of proportions and odds ratio was performed using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was investigated using test of subgroup differences and 95 % prediction intervals.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 401 studies, representing 458,754 participants across 58 countries. Pooled prevalence of depression was 28.5 % (95 % CI: 26.3-30.7), anxiety was 28.7 % (95 % CI: 26.5-31.0), PTSD was 25.5 % (95 % CI: 22.5-28.5), alcohol and substance use disorder was 25.3 % (95 % CI: 13.3-39.6) and insomnia was 24.4 % (95 % CI: 19.4-29.9). Prevalence rates were stratified by physicians, nurses, allied health, support staff and healthcare students, which varied considerably. There were significantly higher odds of probable mental health disorders in women, those working in high-risk units and those providing direct care.
LIMITATIONS: Majority of studies used self-report measures which reflected probable mental health disorders rather than actual diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: These updated findings have enhanced our understanding of at-risk groups working in hospitals. Targeted support and research towards these differences in mental health risks are recommended to mitigate any long-term consequences.","Conflict of interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.

500,pub.1156216275,10.1111/bjhp.12658,36919887,,Procrastination and health: A longitudinal test of the roles of stress and health behaviours,"OBJECTIVES: Procrastination is a common form of self-regulation failure that a growing evidence base suggests can confer risk for poor health outcomes, especially when it becomes habitual. However, the proposed linkages of chronic procrastination to health outcomes have not been tested over time or accounted for the contributions of higher-order personality factors linked to both chronic procrastination and health-related outcomes. We addressed these issues by examining the role of chronic procrastination in health outcomes over time in which the hypothesized links of procrastination to health problems operate via stress and health behaviours.
DESIGN: Three-wave longitudinal study with 1-month intervals.
METHODS: Participants (N = 379) completed measures of trait procrastination at Time 1, and measures of health behaviours, stress and health problems at each time point, in a lab setting.
RESULTS: Procrastination and the health variables were inter-related in the expected directions across the three assessments. Chronic procrastination was positively associated with stress and negatively with health behaviours at each time point. Path analysis testing a cross-lagged longitudinal mediation model found an indirect relationship operating between procrastination and health problems via stress, after accounting for the contributions of conscientiousness and neuroticism.
CONCLUSIONS: This research extends previous work by demonstrating that the links between chronic procrastination and poor health are accounted for mainly by higher stress, after accounting for other key traits, and that these associations are robust over time. The findings are discussed in terms of the importance of addressing habitual self-regulation failure for improving health.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT All authors declare no conflict of interest.,,British Journal of Health Psychology,,,2023-03-15,2023,2023-03-15,2023-03-15,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Sirois, Fuschia M.; Stride, Christopher B.; Pychyl, Timothy A.","Sirois, Fuschia M.

The method allows the recognition of groups using trajectories only and thus opens up the possibility of studying crowds in public places without constrains caused by privacy protection issues. Trajectories from a railway platform in Switzerland were used to analyse the waiting behaviour of passengers in dependence of waiting time as well as the size of social groups. The analysis of the trajectories shows that the portion of passengers travelling in groups reaches up to 10% during the week and increases to 20% on the weekends. 60% of the groups were pairs, larger groups were less frequent. With increasing group size, the mean speed of the members decreases. Individuals and pairs often choose waiting spots at the sides of the stairs and in vicinity of obstacles, while larger groups wait close to the platform entries. The results indicate that passengers choose waiting places according to the following criteria and ranking: shortest ways, direction of the next intended action, undisturbed places and ensured communication. While individual passengers often wait in places where they are undisturbed and do not hinder others, the dominating comfort criterion for groups is to ensure communication. The results regarding space requirements of waiting passengers could be used for different applications. E.g. to enhance the level of service concept assessing the comfort of different types of users, to avoid temporary bottlenecks to improve the boarding and alighting process or to increase the robustness of the performance of railway platforms during peak loads by optimising the pedestrian distribution.",The authors would like to thank the Swiss Federal Railways for providing the data and the student assistants for their help with the visual group assessment.,"This study is a part of the project “CroMa – Crowd Management in Verkehrsinfrastrukturen” which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under grant number 13N14530.

We used a network science approach to foreground this interdependence. Specifically, within two large state-based interhospital networks, we examined the relationship of a hospital's network position with in-hospital mortality and length of stay.
METHODS: We constructed interhospital network graphs using data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project and the American Hospital Association Annual Survey for Florida (2014) and California (2011). The exposure of interest was hospital centrality, defined as weighted degree (sum of all ties to a given hospital from other hospitals). The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and length of stay with sub-analyses for four acute medical conditions: pneumonia, heart failure, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction. We compared outcomes for each quartile of hospital centrality relative to the most central quartile (Q4), independent of patient- and hospital-level characteristics, in this retrospective cross-sectional study.
RESULTS: The inpatient cohorts had 1,246,169 patients in Florida and 1,415,728 in California. Compared to Florida's central hospitals which had an overall mortality 1.60%, peripheral hospitals had higher in-hospital mortality (1.97%, adjusted OR (95%CI): Q1 1.61 (1.37, 1.89), p<0.001). Hospitals in the middle quartiles had lower in-hospital mortality compared to central hospitals (%, adjusted OR (95% CI): Q2 1.39%, 0.79 (0.70, 0.89), p<0.001; Q3 1.33%, 0.78 (0.70, 0.87), p<0.001). Peripheral hospitals had longer lengths of stay (adjusted incidence rate ratio (95% CI): Q1 2.47 (2.44, 2.50), p<0.001). These findings were replicated in California, and in patients with heart failure and pneumonia in Florida. These results show a u-shaped distribution of outcomes based on hospital network centrality quartile.
CONCLUSIONS: The position of hospitals within an inter-hospital network is associated with patient outcomes. Specifically, hospitals located in the peripheral or central positions may be most vulnerable to diminished quality outcomes due to the network. Results should be replicated with deeper clinical data.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,United States; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Length of Stay; Inpatients; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitals; Hospital Mortality; Pneumonia; Heart Failure,2023-03-15,2023,2023-03-15,,18,3,e0281871,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bergmark, Regan W.; Jin, Ginger; Semco, Robert S.; Santolini, Marc; Olsen, Margaret A.; Dhand, Amar","Bergmark, Regan W.

We described the prevalence of breastfeeding and explored experiences of care, support, and stigma related to infant feeding. Setting: Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia (Canada). Methods: Data were obtained from the HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS) surveys, conducted between 2013 and 2018. Results: Breastfeeding was reported by 73.5% of the 786 women who delivered before HIV diagnosis and 7.3% of the 289 women who delivered after HIV diagnosis. Among them, earlier year of delivery, delivery outside of Canada, and African, Caribbean, Black ethnicity were independently associated with increased odds of breastfeeding. Among WLWH who had a live birth during the last year, 77% (40/52) felt that they had received support regarding infant feeding practices, and 77% (23/30) were concerned that not breastfeeding could lead to them being identified as WLWH. Among 71 women within one year postpartum at any one of the study waves, 89% reported having an undetectable viral load. Conclusion: Breastfeeding experiences were common among WLWH, most often prior to HIV diagnosis. Fear of unintentional HIV status disclosure when not breastfeeding and challenges to maintain an undetectable HIV viral load are important issues to address during postpartum care.","The members of the CHIWOS Research Team thank all of the women living with HIV who participated in the research and entrusted CHIWOS with their experiences of HIV treatment, care and support.

It is a syndrome of acquired cognitive impairment with a complex pathophysiological basis. A novel herbal formulation (Sailuotong; SLT) consisting of Panax ginseng C.A Mey, Ginkgo biloba L and Crocus sativus L extracts was developed to treat VaD. Preclinical animal studies found significant improvements in memory and in pathogenic biochemical parameters. Appropriate safety of SLT was shown in acute and chronic toxicity studies, and early clinical trials of SLT demonstrated enhancements in cognition in VaD patients. A fully powered study with a long intervention period is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of this novel intervention. A rigorous phase III clinical trial was developed with the aim of recruiting 238 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate probable VaD, or VaD mixed with Alzheimer's disease (where cerebrovascular disease is the clinical dominant contributor to dementia, abbreviated as CVD+AD). Using a permuted block strategy, participants will be randomly allocated to receive SLT (120 mg bd) or placebo capsules for an intervention period of 52 weeks and will be followed-up for an additional 13 weeks. The primary outcome measures are the Vascular Dementia Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale. Secondary outcome measures include the Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change-Plus, CLOX, EXIT-25, Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician rating scale, and Dementia Quality of Life questionnaire. Safety is assessed through adverse event reports and liver, renal, and coagulation studies. Primary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between treatment and placebo groups, using intention to treat and per protocol analyses. We hypothesise that a 52-week treatment of SLT will be clinically effective and well tolerated in participants with VaD or AD+CVD. This project will provide vital efficacy and safety data for this novel treatment approach to VaD.","The authors would like to thank Mayryl Duxbury, Kellie Bilinski, Lena Hattom, and Genevieve Steiner for assisting with this project.","Australia Shineway Technology Pty Ltd provide the funding and medication to support the conduct of this trial.

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) regulates neuron-to-glia signaling to drive glial phagocytosis for targeted neuron pruning. We find that FMRP acts in a mothers against decapentaplegic (Mad)-insulin receptor (InR)-protein kinase B (Akt) pathway to regulate pretaporter (Prtp) and amyloid precursor protein-like (APPL) signals directing this glial clearance. Neuronal RNAi of Drosophila fragile X mental retardation 1 (dfmr1) elevates mad transcript levels and increases pMad signaling. Neuronal dfmr1 and mad RNAi both elevate phospho-protein kinase B (pAkt) and delay neuron removal but cause opposite effects on InR expression. Genetically correcting pAkt levels in the mad RNAi background restores normal remodeling. Consistently, neuronal dfmr1 and mad RNAi both decrease Prtp levels, whereas neuronal InR and akt RNAi increase Prtp levels, indicating FMRP works with pMad and insulin signaling to tightly regulate Prtp signaling and thus control glial phagocytosis for correct circuit remodeling. Neuronal dfmr1 and mad and akt RNAi all decrease APPL levels, with the pathway signaling higher glial endolysosome activity for phagocytosis. These findings reveal a FMRP-dependent control pathway for neuron-to-glia communication in neuronal pruning, identifying potential molecular mechanisms for devising fragile X syndrome treatments.","We are particularly grateful to Dr. Benjamin Altenhein (University of Cologne, Germany) for the generous gift of the anti-Repo antibody and Dr. Doris Kretzschmar (Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA) for the generous gift of the anti-APPL antibody.
