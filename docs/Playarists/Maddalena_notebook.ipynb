Referencing works that inspired a particular work provide the reader with the possibility of accessing primary sources, hence, enhancing scholarly communication and community evaluation of a research.\n",

The research provides further insight into the available data, evaluating which countries and disciplines provide the larger number of publications and journals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Study design and methodology</b>: We use data from multiple sources: OpenCitations Meta, a database that stores and delivers bibliographic metadata about citations; ERIH-PLUS, an academic Social Science and humanities journal index; DOAJ, the directory of open access journals to retrieve data about open access journals. These data are fetched, filtered, and processed by means of Python Programming Language. The code will be published and available in a GitHub repository, along with instructions on how to use it, to provide users full access to reproduce this analysis at any moment in time. Finally, output data will be visualized in an intuitive and user friendly way.\n",

    "* <b>Findings</b>: Considering the diverse problematics and the reluctance that revolve around opening the scholarly knowledge in the SSH domain, we expect to find an increasing but still not enough full open access journals.

    "*  by concatenating Print and Online ISSN in the ERIH-PLUS dataset to match them with OC Meta dataset (line 12 of <code>process.py</code>) we are losing the information of which identifiers belong to the same venue. Might this be a problem later when we are merging this result list of matching issn again with ERIH-PLUS dataset? AND then again online and print ones are concatenated (line 29). \n",
    "\n",
    "* In general I think we need to be more careful while performing these operations and try the code with files that provide different scenarions. So far I was running with the first 5 csv in the dump and in 4 of them there were no matches of issn, so I didn't manage to test properly some part of the code where dataframes of different batches are concatenated, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are we sure that OpenCitations Meta dump always only have 1 issn in the venue column? what happens if there are more? (the <code>.extract()</code> method only matches the first occurrence I understood (line 6 of <code>process.py</code>))\n",
    "\n",
    "* I think line 40: <code> merged_data['EP_ISSN'] = merged_data['EP_Print_ISSN'].combine_first(merged_data['EP_Online_ISSN'])</code> could be risky since it is creating a new ISSN column by substituting nan values in Print ISSN column with the value in Online ISSN. Both Print and Online ISSN columns are dropped after. This means that we lose the Online ISSN if the Print ISSN was there, keeping just one ISSN for a venue that had multiple issn. However, this might not be a problem since OpenCitations Meta issn are matched before this operation and we might not need to keep multiple ids once we know which internal identifiers are matching. We need to discuss this together with the group. I personally think that keeping all identifiers is a much cleaner and safer way to go."
