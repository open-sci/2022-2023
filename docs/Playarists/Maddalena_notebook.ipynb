Referencing works that inspired a particular work provide the reader with the possibility of accessing primary sources, hence, enhancing scholarly communication and community evaluation of a research.\n",

The research provides further insight into the available data, evaluating which countries and disciplines provide the larger number of publications and journals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Study design and methodology</b>: We use data from multiple sources: OpenCitations Meta, a database that stores and delivers bibliographic metadata about citations; ERIH-PLUS, an academic Social Science and humanities journal index; DOAJ, the directory of open access journals to retrieve data about open access journals. These data are fetched, filtered, and processed by means of Python Programming Language. The code will be published and available in a GitHub repository, along with instructions on how to use it, to provide users full access to reproduce this analysis at any moment in time. Finally, output data will be visualized in an intuitive and user friendly way.\n",

    "* <b>Originality</b>: Our study provides valuable insights into the current state of the openness of Social Science and Humanities publications and provide reusable data for enhancing further research about Open Science in the Scientometrics domain.\n",

    "* <b>Limitations</b>: The research is based on the current state and reliability of publicly available data, which might not encompass the entire landscape of SSH publications.
