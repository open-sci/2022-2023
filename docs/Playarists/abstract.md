## Abstract

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the representation and distribution of Social Science and Humanities (SSH) journals in the OpenCitations Meta database. It specifically focuses on their Open Access (OA) status and their dispersion across various disciplines and countries.

Study Design and Methodology: The study is grounded on the premise that open infrastructures are crucial for ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and fostering trust in scientific research. The research utilized secondary data retrieved from the OpenCitations Meta database, the ERIH-PLUS bibliographic index, and the DOAJ index. A purpose-tailored research software in Python programming language was created to process and analyze the data.

Findings: Our findings indicate that OpenCitations Meta encompasses 78.1% of SSH journals indexed in the European Reference Index for the Humanities (ERIH-PLUS), with Psychology emerging as the discipline with the highest number of publications. The United States and the United Kingdom are identified as the countries contributing the most publications. However, only 38% of the SSH journals within OpenCitations Meta are OA.

Originality: The study highlights the necessity for advocating OA practices within SSH and the significance of open data for bibliometric studies. It further encourages additional research into the impact of OA on various facets of citation patterns and the factors leading to disparity across disciplinary representation. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the representation of SSH in open bibliographic databases and the importance of open access in this field.
