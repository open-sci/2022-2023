## Abstract

* <b>Purpose</b>: In the Social Science and Humanities domain, citations hold a central role in measuring the reliability and interconnectedness of a publication as well as its long-term impact. Referencing works that inspired a study allow readers to access its primary sources, enhancing scholarly communication and community evaluation.
This project aims to assess the state of the art of Social Science and Humanities journals' citation data coverage in OpenCitation databases and investigate how many of these are Open Access. The research provides further insights into which countries and disciplines hold the most publications and journals.

* <b>Study design and methodology</b>: Data are gathered from the OpenCitations Meta database, storing citations' bibliographic metadata, ERIH-PLUS, an academic Social Science and humanities journal index, and the DOAJ index of open access journals. These data are fetched, filtered, and processed through Python Programming Language.

* <b>Findings</b>: Considering the diverse problematics and the reluctance surrounding the openness of scholarly knowledge in the SSH domain, we expect to find an increasing, though still insufficient, number of fully open-access journals. Nonetheless, this deficiency might be partly counterbalanced by a significant number of open citation metadata.

* <b>Originality</b>: Our study provides valuable insights into the openness of Social Science and Humanities publications and reusable data for enhancing further research about Open Science in the Scientometrics domain. Furthermore, we believe that increased open access to SSH research can promote cross-disciplinary collaboration and wider dissemination of knowledge.
