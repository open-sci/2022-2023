## Abstract

This study investigates the representation and distribution of Social Science and Humanities (SSH) journals in the OpenCitations Meta database, focusing on their Open Access (OA) status and the distribution across disciplines and countries. The study is based on premise that open infrastructures are fundamental for transparency, reproducibility, and trust in scientific research. Our analysis reveals that OpenCitations Meta covers 78.1% of SSH journals listed in the European Reference Index for the Humanities (ERIH-PLUS), with Psychology being the discipline with the highest number of publications. The United States and the United Kingdom are the countries providing the largest number of publications. However, only 38% of the SSH journals covered by OpenCitations Meta are OA. The study highlights the need for promoting OA practices in SSH and the importance of open data for bibliometric studies. It also calls for further research into the impact of OA on various aspects of citation patterns and the factors contributing to disparity across disciplinary representation.
