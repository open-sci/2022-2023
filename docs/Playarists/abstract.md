## Abstract


Title: Open Access and Coverage Analysis of Social Science and Humanities Journals in OpenCitations Meta

Purpose: This project aims to assess the coverage and open access status of publications in Social Science and Humanities (SSH) journals, as classified by ERIH-PLUS, within the OpenCitations Meta dataset. We investigate the disciplines with the highest number of publications, the countries contributing the most to publication and journal counts, and the proportion of SSH journals available in Open Access as per the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).

Study design/methodology/approach: Utilizing data from multiple sources, including ERIH-PLUS, OpenCitations Meta, and DOAJ, we perform a comprehensive analysis by fetching, processing, and analyzing the data using Python programming. This approach allows for a detailed examination of SSH publications in the context of open science.

Originality/value: Our study provides valuable insights into the current state of SSH publications, contributing to the understanding of open access trends and the visibility of SSH research.

Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of our study is the reliance on publicly available data, which might not encompass the entire landscape of SSH publications. Furthermore, the rapidly changing nature of open access policies and journal classifications may affect the results.
Practical implications: The findings of our study can inform researchers, publishers, and policymakers on the current state of SSH publications and open access trends. This information can be used to develop strategies and initiatives to further enhance the visibility and accessibility of SSH research, promoting the adoption of open science practices.

Social implications: By shedding light on the coverage and open access status of SSH journals, our study has the potential to contribute to a more equitable and accessible scholarly communication landscape. Increased open access to SSH research can enable broader societal engagement, foster cross-disciplinary collaboration, and promote the dissemination of knowledge to a wider audience.
