    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>by looking at citations data contained in COCI, the number of citations included in Meta which refer to publication in SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities) journals indicated in ERIH-PLUS</li>\n",

    "    </ul>\n",
    "For this reason, we approach the problem from a computational point of view. We started by extracting only the relevant data by operating a first processing of COCI, ERIH-PLUS and META's datasets. Then we built a python software able to analyse the csv format data, querying them in order to retrieve the info needed and to present the results in a clear and understandable way, which will be available through different data formats like csv and json. The findings show that there are no meaningful differences in the number of citations coming from different disciplines, since it is related to the subject of the study, while the ones cited the most belong to psychology, health and science studies. The research conducted by us has the purpose to add information to existing resources with the aim of facilitating their use and allowing the researchers to have a clearer view of the data contained in each dataset. Further development can be made, for example analysing other disciplines, to have the same overview as the one created by us but related to other fields.\n",
