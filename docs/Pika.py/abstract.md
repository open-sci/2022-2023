<b>Purpose</b>: we want to find out
  1. by looking at citations data contained in COCI, the number of citations included in Meta which refer to publication in SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities) journals indicated in ERIH-PLUS
  2. the disciplines citing the most VS the disciplines cited the most
  3. the citations from/to publication contained in Meta which are not included in SSH journals
We want to create a connection between these three different datasets for having an overall view of the citations present in each of them.

<b>Methodology</b>: we approach the problem from a computational point of view, by building a python software able to analyse the data, querying them in order to retrieve the info needed and to present the results in a clear and understandable way.

<b>Findings</b>: for what concerns the findings, we can see that there are no meaningful differences in the number of citations coming from different disciplines, since it is related to the subject of the study, while the ones cited the most belong to psychology, health and science studies.

<b>Originality/Value</b>: the research conducted by us can be defined as very valuable, since it adds information to existing resources with the aim of facilitating their use and allowing the users to have a clearer view of the data contained in each dataset. Further development can be made, for example analysing other disciplines, to have the same overview as the one created by us but related to other fields.
