<b>Purpose</b>

The main purpose of this research is to answer to three different questions and find out:
the number of citations which refer to publications in Social Sciences and Humanities journals included in ERIH-PLUS, by looking at citations data contained in OpenCitations COCI and OpenCitations Meta;
the most citing and the most cited SSH discipline, according to the above mentioned datasets;
the citations coming from and going to publications contained in OpenCitations Meta which are not included in SSH journals.
We want to draw a line that connects these three different datasets, aiming at  offering an overall view of the citations landscape of each of them.

<b>Methodology</b>

For this purpose, we approach the problem from a computational point of view. We extract only the relevant data by operating a first preprocessing of COCI, ERIH-PLUS and META's datasets. Then we build a python software able to analyze CSVs data, querying them to retrieve information needed and to present the results in a clear and understandable way. 

<b>Findings</b>

The findings show that the majority of citations come from and go to psychology publications, and a deep gap exists between the number of citations included in SSH journals and the number of citations that are not included in SSH journals.


<b>Originality/Value</b>

The research conducted by us has the purpose to add information to existing resources with the aim of facilitating their use and allowing the researchers to have a clearer view of the data contained in each dataset. In addition, the research has the purpose to gather information that may be useful for understanding which is the most influential discipline in the SSH field and to provide a solid starting point for further studies regarding this subject.
