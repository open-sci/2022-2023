<b>Purpose</b>

The main purpose of our research is to answer to three different question and find out:
by looking at citations data contained in COCI, the number of citations included in Meta which refer to publication in SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities) journals indicated in ERIH-PLUS
the disciplines citing the most VS the disciplines cited the most
the citations from/to publication contained in Meta which are not included in SSH journals
We want to create a connection between these three different datasets for having an overall view of the citations present in each of them.

<b>Methodology</b>

For this reason, we approach the problem from a computational point of view. We started by extracting only the relevant data by operating a first processing of COCI, ERIH-PLUS and META's datasets. Then we built a python software able to analyze the CSV format data, querying them in order to retrieve the info needed and to present the results in a clear and understandable way, which will be available in CSV format. 

<b>Findings</b>

The findings show that the majority of citations come from and go to Psychology publications, and a good amount of citations according to the three datasets is involved in SSH publications. 


<b>Originality/Value</b>

The research conducted by us has the purpose to add information to existing resources with the aim of facilitating their use and allowing the researchers to have a clearer view of the data contained in each dataset. Further development can be made, for example analyzing other disciplines, to have the same overview as the one created by us but related to other fields.
